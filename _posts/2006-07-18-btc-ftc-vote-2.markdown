<p>Thanks to everyone who voted in the first By The Community, For The Community vote, we had almost 1000 votes, and an overwhelming vote for the Event Organization Site.  Mitch has already started working on it, and we should see it online about August 4th.</p>
<p>In the mean time, check out this weeks poll at <a href="http://www.asp.net/Default.aspx?tabindex=6&amp;tabid=50">http://www.asp.net/Default.aspx?tabindex=6&amp;tabid=50</a>.  This months vote includes a few from last month, and a few new ones.  We've also added a suggestion box, so if you've got some ideas on what you'd like to see written, drop us a line!</p>
