<p>One of the things I've been experiementing with for some time now is ways of making Flickr work with ASP.NET and other .NET languages.  Originally, I wanted to write my own support layer, but quickly realized that it was likely a lot more work than I really wanted to get into.  I started looking to see what I could find that was already built and ready for me to start using.</p>
<p>That's when I came across <a href="http://www.wackylabs.net/flickr/flickr-api/">Flickr.NET</a>. After checking it out, it looks like it' is going to do all the stuff I wanted to do, plus more which is killer!  Then today, as I was reading my regular blogroll, I came across a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/webcoder/flickr/default.aspx">great post</a> on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/">Coding4Fun</a> about how to use the Flick.NET API's and figured I'd share.</p>
<p>Definately worth checking out if you're interested in creating some kind of mash up with Flickr!</p>
