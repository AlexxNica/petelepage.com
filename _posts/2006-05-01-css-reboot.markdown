<p>Darn, I found out about this a little too late for this go round, but I'm going to do it for next time.&nbsp; Honest!</p>
<p>Have you heard about <a href="http://www.cssreboot.com/">CSS Reboot</a>?&nbsp; The idea is that twice a year, participating websites redo their CSS pages and come up with new, fun, exciting, and stylish layouts, and there are prizes given out for the best ranked website.</p>
<p>Today was the day, though it last happened on November 1st, so it sounds like it's a twice a year thing.&nbsp; I found out about it by reading <a href="http://www.mattbrett.com">Matt Brett's blog</a>.&nbsp; He's the guy who I linked to in my <a href="/petel/archive/2006/04/28/586236.aspx">last post</a> about the RSS feeds.&nbsp; He created the RSS feed icon website and is hosting that.&nbsp; So, next fall, I'll be sure to post about it with a little more notice, and hell, maybe I'll toss in some prizes and do my own CSS reboot!</p>
