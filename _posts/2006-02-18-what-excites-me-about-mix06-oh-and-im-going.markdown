<p>When the ad first popped up on campus about Mix06, I thought it was going to be a pretty neat conference.  Not your average conference, and sure, it's not going to change the world, but I think it will help shape the so called "Web 2.0".  Ideas will flow, people will talk, and people will learn.  Thats where this all goes.  You put a bunch of cutting edge web people in a room, and then mix with other talent, and share, you get great things.  And thats exactly what Mix06 is going to be.I really wanted to participate, and put the bug in my leads (and his leads, and his leads and his leads) ear a while ago.  Yesterday, I got official notification, I'm going!  Kick Ass!There are a few sessions that I'm going to do my best to be at.  Anything to do with Atlas/Ajax, Live.Com and whats going on with IE7.  Live.com is great, and so are the cool things that are coming out of MSN these days.</p>
