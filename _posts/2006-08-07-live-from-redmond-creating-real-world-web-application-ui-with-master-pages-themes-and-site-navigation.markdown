A few days ago, I presented a [Live From Redmond: Creating Real World Web Application UI with Master Pages, Themes and Site Navigation](http://www.microsoft.com/events/EventDetails.aspx?CMTYSvcSource=MSCOMMedia&amp;Params=%7eCMTYDataSvcParams%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22ID%22+Value%3d%221032303787%22%2f%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22ProviderID%22+Value%3d%22A6B43178-497C-4225-BA42-DF595171F04C%22%2f%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22lang%22+Value%3d%22en%22%2f%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22cr%22+Value%3d%22US%22%2f%5e%7esParams%5e%7e%2fsParams%5e%7e%2fCMTYDataSvcParams%5e) in an on demand web cast.  For my first presentation, it went pretty well.  I had never used Live Meeting before, and had only had one Live Meeting "Goofup", where I forgot to shift over to the desktop, instead of the slides.

The presentation went well, but admittedly, there was a lot of information presented, an hour was really way too short to do everything that I wanted to talk about.  In fact, I cut out a good chunk of stuff as I was moving through in order to get through to site navigation and themes in the last few minutes.

In any event, I had said that I would offer the sample for download after the presentation, and so here it is. You can download it at [http://www.nocommonground.com/blogSamples/finishedsite.zip](http://www.nocommonground.com/blogSamples/finishedsite.zip). It's about 6 megs to download but contains everything that I demo'ed in it's completed form, so you can use that as a sample for where you want to go.
