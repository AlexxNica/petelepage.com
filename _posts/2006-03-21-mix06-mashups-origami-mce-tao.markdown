<p>We're about 1/2 of the way through day 2 here, and there is still some great stuff happening here.&nbsp; If you didn't hear, yesterday, we announced a <a href="http://atlas.asp.net">Go Live license for Atlas</a>!&nbsp; This freakin' rocks!&nbsp; I'm really looking forward to starting to play with it more!</p>
<p><strong>MashUps</strong></p>
<p>After sitting through some of the keynotes and other sessions yesterday, I got an idea for a mash up that I want to play with.&nbsp; If you've noticed, I love photography.&nbsp; I use my own web server to serve my images and put all my stuff online there.&nbsp; But the problem is that it's not very accessible on the big websites, for example, if I tag something, it isn't getting picked up very well.&nbsp; So, I want to create a new front face for flickr.&nbsp; I've created my account, and have started looking at the API's taht are available to me.&nbsp; Ch-Ching!&nbsp; I'm going to be able to get somthign cool going pretty easily it looks like.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Origami</strong></p>
<p>There's an Orgami device here, and I got to play with it earlier today.&nbsp; All hype aside, the sucker is pretty cool.&nbsp; they had a very different versions there and available to play with and yes I want one.&nbsp; Sure the device is small, but its very usable, and is going to be great for home, or bus or other small scale stuff.&nbsp; Sure, I can't do web development or other development on it, but I can do a whole heck of a lot of cool stuff.</p>
<p><strong>MCE</strong></p>
<p>They did the MCE keynote this morning, and it was pretty slick.&nbsp; If you've read my blog, you know I use a Mac at home, and have a Tivo.&nbsp; Seeing some of the Vista demos, the Origami, and other such things, as soon as Vista ships, I'm dropping both my mac and my Tivo.&nbsp; Media Center is pretty damn slick.&nbsp; The Vista version is really nice, an updated UI, support for HiDef, high end sound and all sorts of other things.&nbsp; Sure, today I get basic cable, but to be able to get HiDef offline, and my basic cable, is pretty great.&nbsp; I also figured out how to stream XM Radio and NPR radio on to the media center right in Media Center.&nbsp; I know you can do that on a basic computer, but this is streaming it right in to MCE, which is pretty slick!</p>
<p><strong>Tao</strong></p>
<p>Last night was the attendee party.&nbsp; I normally like these parties a lot, but last nights wasn't all that great.&nbsp; Sure, the free alcohol helped, but think the stereo typical dark club, and thats where we were.&nbsp; It was to dark to really find anyone, and too loud to really talk to anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few of us ended up going out for dinner instead and had a good opportunity to talk about some of the upcoming challenges that we're going to see and have to deal with.</p>
