In Amsterdam at ReMIX, I presented "Implementing Rich UI for Web Applications" where I showed how to deliver richly interactive web experiences with animation, video and more using Silverlight and Expression.

It was based on a session from MIX07 by Joe Stegman titled "[Building Rich Web Experiences using Silverlight and JavaScript for Developers](http://sessions.visitmix.com/default.asp?event=1011&amp;session=2012&amp;pid=DEV11&amp;disc=&amp;id=1520&amp;year=2007&amp;search=DEV11)"
