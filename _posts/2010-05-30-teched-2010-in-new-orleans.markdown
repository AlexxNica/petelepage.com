![CCL_audio_books.indd](/assets/TechEd10_Blog_BeThere_180.gif "CCL_audio_books.indd")I’m spending part of my memorial day weekend preparing for [TechEd](http://www.microsoft.com/events/techednorthamerica/) next week because I want to try something new and it’s going to require some extra work. Thankfully the weather is pretty crumby here in Seattle this weekend, so it’s not like I’m missing a great weather weekend. Ah well! I guess I get to make up for it by hitting Orlando before I head down to New Orleans.

The Top 10 Design Mistakes session is probably one of my favorites! It’s really fun and interactive, we look at some of my favorite sites, and have an opportunity to look at your favorites The Lap Around Internet Explorer 9 session is the one that I’m most excited about. First of all, I’m forgoing PowerPoint completely, and am instead going to do everything in Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview 2! I’m working to build an AJAX application that will give me some of the same features as PowerPoint, but since it’s in HTML, it’ll be easier and more fun to show the samples, sources and such. 

Here’s a list of the sessions that I’ll be presenting at TechEd this year…

### Top Ten Design Mistakes Made By Web Developers (WEB04-INT)

We've all seen those sites where it's obvious the developer didn't consult a designer. There's no user experience flow, the colors clash, you don’t quite know what to do on the site. During this session, we take a look at the top mistakes made by Web developers when they don't have access to Web designers; and hopefully learn a few techniques for making sure your sites look great!    
_Monday June 7th, 2010 @ 1:00pm – 2:15pm – Room 350_

### A Lap Around Internet Explorer 9 For Developers (WEB302)

Internet Explorer 9 contains many new features that give developers many new options for building rich Web applications. From enhanced features like the developer tools and or support for more DOM interactivity – Internet Explorer 9 is the browser you’ve been asking for. We take a dive into these features and learn how you can take advantage of brand new APIs like HTML5, SVG, and Direct2D Graphics support.    
_Tuesday June 8th, 2010 @ 9:45am – 11:00am – Room 276_

### Using HTML5 Features In Internet Explorer 8 (WEB06-INT)

Internet Explorer 8 has support for many HTML5 features, but do you know what they are or how to use them? We provide a quick overview of those features, see how they’re supported, and then dive into the code and see real examples of how they work. We take an existing Web site, and implement HTML5 features to make the Web site more performant, and powerful in Internet Explorer 8, and other browsers that have support for some HTML5 features.    
_Wednesday June 9th, 2010 @ 8:00am – 9:15am – Room 349_

### Protecting You Web Applications (WEB301)

Every day, hackers try to compromise users and Web sites. How can you protect your users from phishing attacks, or cross site scripting, SQL injection attacks, and all of the other risks on the Internet. Keeping your users protected requires an end-to-end solution, which starts with the browser, and ends with your applications. We pull back the covers on the best practices for building secure Web applications whether they live on the Internet or the Intranet and features offered by modern browsers that help ensure your application isn’t going to be the next “story at 11”.    
_Wednesday June 9th, 2010 @ 11:45am – 1:00pm – Room 388_

### Best Practices For Building Fast Web Applications (WEB05-INT)

Building high performance Web applications takes skill and some unique know how. Come learn about some of the common pitfalls we’ve learned in JavaScript, CSS, HTML and HTTP requests that could drastically improve the performance of your Web applications. While the session focuses on using Windows Internet Explorer as the tool to get there, these lessons apply to all browsers!    
_Thursday June 10th, 2010 @ 1:30pm – 2:45pm – Room 350_

If I’m not presenting, you can probably find me in the Internet Explorer TLC area in the blue section of the Exhibit Hall. We’ll have a bunch of folks from the team there to help answer questions, and show some cool Internet Explorer 9 demos!

Will I see you there? Hope so!
