<p>Whew, I'm back from my 17 day cruise in the Mediterranian and while it's good to be back, I sure missed a lot!  I'm still trying to get things sorted, but in the mean time I figured I'd share this little juicy bit with you.</p>
<p>Verio is offering free Windows based hosting for anyone who wants it!  They don't require a credit card, and the offer is good through January 2010, so you get a good couple of years out of this.  The offer is not available online (huh?), so you have to call and deal with a human.  And since it's a 1-800 number, that'll make it a bit harder for those outside the USA.</p>
<p>In any event, if you want to take advantage of it, call Verio at 1.800.932.7483!  And feel free to pass along</p>
