<p>Our team just launched a team blog.&nbsp; It's open to anyone to post and in the coming weeks, you'll see lots of new information.&nbsp; So far, we've only got an intro post from Bash, our PUM and an intro post from me, but I'll try to get something a bit more substantial up there this weekend.</p>
