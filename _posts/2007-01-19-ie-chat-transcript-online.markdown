I want to thank everyone who came attended today's chat, we had a great turn out this morning!  It's a lot of fun to talk to other web developers and web designers.  We move forward by talking to you, and hearing what you want, and this is a great opportunity for us, and it's a cool way to help you figure out some of the stuff you're working on.

I should also thank you guys for putting up with LiveMeeting instead of a real chat client.  We'll be moving into a proper chat client in the near future.  There were some problems getting it set up in time for this chat, so we used LiveMeeting instead..

I've posted the [transcript](http://blogs.msdn.com/petel/pages/designer-expert-chat-transcript-1-18-07.aspx) online, and we'll be getting it into a more permanant place, I just wanted to get it online and available as quickly as possible.

The chats will continue, keep an eye on the [IE Developer Center](http://msdn.com/ie) or the [IE Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie) as we'll be posting upcoming chats and web casts there.  We'll also try to make sure they're available online after so that those who can't make it can still get the information.
