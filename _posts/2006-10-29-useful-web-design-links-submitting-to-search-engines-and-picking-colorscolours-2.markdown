<p>I just finished teaching "From Prints To Online: Creating Your Own Website" class at PCNW and we found a couple of useful links that I though I would share.</p>
<p>Getting listed on the major search engines:<br />Google: <a href="http://www.google.com/addurl/?continue=/addurl">http://www.google.com/addurl/?continue=/addurl</a><br />Search.MSN.Com: <a href="http://search.msn.com/docs/submit.aspx">http://search.msn.com/docs/submit.aspx</a><br />Yahoo: <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/free/mobile/request">http://search.yahoo.com/free/mobile/request</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;We were also searching for custom colours to use on your website, and when we searched for colors, we came across the <a class="" href="http://www.ficml.org/jemimap/style/color/wheel.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://www.ficml.org/jemimap/style/color/wheel.html">Web Color Wheel</a>.&nbsp; It's a pretty neat little site that lets you move the mouse until you find a colour you like, then it gives you the appropriate HTML color codes that you can use to pick the colors.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</p>
