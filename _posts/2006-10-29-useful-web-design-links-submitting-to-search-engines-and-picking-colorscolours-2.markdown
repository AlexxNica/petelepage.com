I just finished teaching "From Prints To Online: Creating Your Own Website" class at PCNW and we found a couple of useful links that I though I would share.

Getting listed on the major search engines:
Google: [http://www.google.com/addurl/?continue=/addurl](http://www.google.com/addurl/?continue=/addurl)
Search.MSN.Com: [http://search.msn.com/docs/submit.aspx](http://search.msn.com/docs/submit.aspx)
Yahoo: [http://search.yahoo.com/free/mobile/request](http://search.yahoo.com/free/mobile/request)

&nbsp;We were also searching for custom colours to use on your website, and when we searched for colors, we came across the [Web Color Wheel](http://www.ficml.org/jemimap/style/color/wheel.html).&nbsp; It's a pretty neat little site that lets you move the mouse until you find a colour you like, then it gives you the appropriate HTML color codes that you can use to pick the colors.
