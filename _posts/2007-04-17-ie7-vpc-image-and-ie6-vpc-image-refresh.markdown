Hello! Just wanted to give you a quick update that we’ve dropped two new VPC images that you can use with the free copy of [Virtual PC 2007](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/virtualpc/default.mspx).

The first is a refresh of the [Windows XP SP2 + IE6 image](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=21EABB90-958F-4B64-B5F1-73D0A413C8EF&amp;displaylang=en).  A few people were encountering a non-genuine Windows warning from the Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA) Notification Tool. We did not install the WGA Notification tool on the image this time around. As we’ve mentioned in [previous blog posts](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/03/20/ie6-vpc-refresh-now-available.aspx), these images have had their product keys deactivated, thus they don’t pass the WGA tests.

The second VPC image is [Windows XP SP2 + IE7](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=21EABB90-958F-4B64-B5F1-73D0A413C8EF&amp;displaylang=en). You asked, we listened, and here it is. It’s built identically to the IE6 VPC, except just before packaging up the image, I installed IE7 on the machine. You can now test the features of IE7 on XP.

Just a reminder that both images expire on August 17<sup>th</sup>, 2007.
