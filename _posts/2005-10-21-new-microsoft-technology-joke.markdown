Well, I think today is going to be a good day!&nbsp; November 7th approaches very quickly, and with it, comes the release of VS 2005 along with Visual Web Developer.&nbsp; 

But, more importantly, I found out about this new [Microsoft Technology](http://tinyurl.com/cwgp9 ) [Windows Media File] today that sounded like fun.&nbsp; :)
