<p>Well, I think today is going to be a good day!&nbsp; November 7th approaches very quickly, and with it, comes the release of VS 2005 along with Visual Web Developer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But, more importantly, I found out about this new <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cwgp9 ">Microsoft Technology</a> [Windows Media File] today that sounded like fun.&nbsp; :)</p>
