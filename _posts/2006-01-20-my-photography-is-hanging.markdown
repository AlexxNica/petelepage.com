<p>I've got two shows hanging in the very near future, not a lot of my work, but there is some, so if you're interested in seeing any, I'd recommend checking it out! </p>
<p><img src="http://www.bigbackpack.ca/PhotoBackEnd/photos/1/10/140x138.aspx" align="left"/><a href="http://www.pcnw.org/about/contact.php">PCNW Staff &amp; Faculty show</a> is currently hanging at the Photo Center. I've got three pieces hanging in that show. </p>
