On Tuesday, I presented my _IE9: A Lap Around for Developers_ session here at TechEd and it went really well, it was a lot of fun, and the “slide” deck that I presented worked well! As it turns out, [Joab Jackson](http://twitter.com/Joab_Jackson), a reporter for the IDG News Service was in the audience and wrote a really great article that ran on [PC World](http://www.pcworld.com) about how browser speed isn’t just dependant on JavaScript, but is affected by all parts of the browser!

I’ll be posting my slides later this afternoon – just want to finish my last presentation of TechEd!
