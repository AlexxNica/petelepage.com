<p>On Tuesday, I presented my <em>IE9: A Lap Around for Developers</em> session here at TechEd and it went really well, it was a lot of fun, and the “slide” deck that I presented worked well!&#160; As it turns out, <a href="http://twitter.com/Joab_Jackson">Joab Jackson</a>, a reporter for the IDG News Service was in the audience and wrote a really great article that ran on <a href="http://www.pcworld.com">PC World</a> about how browser speed isn’t just dependant on JavaScript, but is affected by all parts of the browser!</p>

<p>I’ll be posting my slides later this afternoon – just want to finish my last presentation of TechEd!</p>
