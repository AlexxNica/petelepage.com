<p>Just a quick note to about the expert chat tomorrow.  It'll be a great opportunity to talk to the IE team about CSS, HTML and other design specific stuff.  If you've got questions, this is the place to ask them.</p>
<p>Register <a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/eventdetail.aspx?EventID=1032324030&amp;Culture=en-US">here</a></p>
<p>We do plan on making it available for download after the session.  We had a small problem with the first one, and unfortunately we lost it, but hopefully we won't lose this one.</p>
<p>Hope to see you tomorrow!</p>
