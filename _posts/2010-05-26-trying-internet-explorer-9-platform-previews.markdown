    Looking forward to IE9 - It certainly looks like a valid contender in the marketplace now.  The only disappointment is that it doesn't support Windows XP. :-(

    Lets just hope that IE6 goes quickly - we can't progress the Web until its gone.

    couldn't agree with you more!  IE6 was a great browser, <strong>10 years ago</strong>...

  content: "i agree with dulon; it is a shame that xp is already being left out. i
    know it is an older os, but many ppl still prefer it. this may prevent ie9 from
    doing better than it could imo. \n\ni tested the ie9 and found that if you don't
    have the hardware to support it, it lacks any significant advantage over ie8.\n\nhowever,
    it does look promising once everyone else catches up..."

    i.e. tab usability, security issue... etc..

Over the last few months at conferences and events, it’s been fun to show off the Internet Explorer 9 Platform Previews! People seem to get pretty excited about it, and understandably so!

The engineering team has been super hard at work making sure that IE9 is going to rock, and to ensure that we’ve got stuff to show you some of the new things we’ve implemented. To do that, they built the Internet Explorer Test Drive Site ([http://ietestdrive.com](http://ietestdrive.com)) which has all of the demos and other fun stuff you can try either in Internet Explorer, or see how it works in other browsers.

If you try it in Internet Explorer 8, you’ll find some of the demos don’t work, for example since IE8 doesn’t support XHTML, any of the XHTML demos are grayed out. You can try side by side in other browsers and see the performance increases that have been made and lots more.

And don’t forget, you can install the Platform Previews side by side with your current Internet Explorer installation, and it won’t cause any problems. That way you can install or remove it as necessary, and continue your day to day stuff without any problems!
