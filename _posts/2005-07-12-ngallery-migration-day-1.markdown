<p>After spending a good bit of time this morning trying to figure out the whole template stuff from nGallery, I finally gave up.  The templates and skins for nGallery are pretty convoluted, with pages being built from just chunks of html in individual pages.Part of the whole migration thing that I wanted to do was use some of the new ASP.NET 2.0 controls, and to do that, I have to get rid of some of the old stuff.  Thus, I figured it'd be easier to start over from scratch.  </p>
<p>The biggest pain in the a** I had today was trying to get the top and bottom rounded corners to work.  I believe very strongly in DIVs as opposed to tables, and I'm trying to build this whole thing using only DIVs.  Well, I had to break down this afternoon and put a TABLE in a DIV to get the desired effect.</p>
<p>I'll post the code tomorrow with what I was trying to do (I'm at home now) and maybe someone can tell me what I was doing wrong, or if there was no way of doing it.</p>
<p>Day 1 was successful, all be it, slow.  Tomorrow is a team meeting most of the afternoon, so I don't expect to get much done, but we'll see.</p>
