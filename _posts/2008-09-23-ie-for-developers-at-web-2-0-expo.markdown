Here's the slide deck from my session at Web 2.0 Expo last week.  I cut out a few things in order to get it to fit in the 50 minute slot they allotted me, so it's kind of short, if you're looking for full details, check out the deck from Fronteers as it has a bit more detail on things.

I did add a bit about search providers to this deck, so there is a little new stuff there.

It was great to be in NYC for the week, and I met a lot of great people.  It was exciting to see all the people who want to see IE8 and hear their excitement about standards and the new features!  I can't wait to deliver!
