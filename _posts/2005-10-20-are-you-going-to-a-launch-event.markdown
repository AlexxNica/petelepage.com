With November 7th only 2 1/2 weeks away, many of the launch events are already booked, but you can still register for them!&nbsp; I'm going to be popping my head in at a few at the "Ask The Experts" area answering questions and such.&nbsp; 

You can find more info about the launch events here:

Canada [http://www.microsoft.com/canada/launch2005/](http://www.microsoft.com/canada/launch2005/)

USA [http://www.microsoft.com/events/2005launchevents/](http://www.microsoft.com/events/2005launchevents/)

I'll let you know what events I plan on attending as things are confirmed, but I suspect I'll be at a few in Canada, and at least the one&nbsp;here in Seattle!
