<p>With November 7th only 2 1/2 weeks away, many of the launch events are already booked, but you can still register for them!&nbsp; I'm going to be popping my head in at a few at the "Ask The Experts" area answering questions and such.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You can find more info about the launch events here:</p>
<p>Canada <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/canada/launch2005/">http://www.microsoft.com/canada/launch2005/</a></p>
<p>USA <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/2005launchevents/">http://www.microsoft.com/events/2005launchevents/</a></p>
<p>I'll let you know what events I plan on attending as things are confirmed, but I suspect I'll be at a few in Canada, and at least the one&nbsp;here in Seattle!</p>
