<p><a href="http://petelepage.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/flag_canada3.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2728 alignright" title="flag_canada3" src="http://petelepage.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/flag_canada3-300x212.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="127" /></a>The last month has been really exciting for the <a href="http://bit.ly/tcqrrG" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a>. Not only did we launch the new (and very much improved user experience), we also launch internationally. The Chrome Web Store is available in lots more countries, but one in particular is close to my heart - Canada. In fact, I was up in Canada last week for a <a href="http://webapphackmtl.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">hack-a-thon</a> and to meet with some great companies to talk about the Chrome Web Store.</p>
<p>With any newly launched product, there are lots of great opportunities for people to jump on board early, and if you're a Web Developer in Canada, this is certainly one of them. On Thursday, we announced a special program for Canadian Web Developers. We want to see more Canadian Web Developers featured with apps that will resonate with Canadians. That's why we're offering a <a href="http://bit.ly/s4O0Fn" target="_blank">great incentive</a> for submitting your apps! Our panel of experts will review the apps that you submit and for each app that <a href="http://bit.ly/sT3UzT" target="_blank">meets the criteria</a>, you will receive a $200 Amazon gift certificate - not to mention exposure to more than 200 million Chrome users around the world.</p>

<p>You've got until December 31, 2011 at midnight (PST) to get your app submitted to the Chrome Web Store and fill out the submission form. You've got just about 2 months to get your app built and submitted.  Be sure to read the complete rules and regulations at <a href="http://bit.ly/sT3UzT" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;"><strong>Web Storage - LocalStorage and SessionStorage:</strong> are both widely implemented and allow for storing of name/value pairs, not good for binary data, but useful for things like lessons completed or topics of interest. The other great way we've seen this used is as a temporary cache until the client can connect to the server to update things. <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/features/storage" target="_blank">http://www.html5rocks.com/en/features/storage</a></span></li>
