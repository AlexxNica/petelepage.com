I just had a coworker come into my office and say "Yay for Spain!" and was really happy to hear that Spain had just approved gay marriage.&nbsp; Spain is only the 3rd* country to legalize gay marriage in the world.&nbsp; I love that I work at such a company where employees value diversity and are happy for other peoples wins.

*Canada is kind of third, but since it's not technically law yet, they'll have to settle for forth.
