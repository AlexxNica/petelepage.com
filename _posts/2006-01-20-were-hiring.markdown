Our team just finished a post-ship re-org, and we've got at least two open head count for testers on our team.&nbsp; We're particularly looking for industry hires (at least a few years testing experience), but if you're graduating this spring, you should apply as well.&nbsp; We're a fun team (much more fun than most of the other DevDiv teams, but I may be biased).
