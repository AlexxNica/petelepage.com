I just finished my keynote for Web Design World in Boston.&nbsp; The topic was "Internet Explorer 7: The Route To Standards Compliance".&nbsp; It was the first "keynote" that I've ever given, and I think it went really well.&nbsp; I had several people come up afterwards and compliment me on the presentation.&nbsp; I was quite happy with it!&nbsp; I usually don't have a problem getting up and speaking in front of people, and the audience was great.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;I said I would post the keynote slides, and wanted to share a few URL that I mentioned in the presentation.
