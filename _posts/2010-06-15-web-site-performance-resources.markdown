At TechEd last week, I presented a session that covered 20 Tips and Tricks for Writing Fast Web Applications. A couple of folks asked for more resources and where they could find more info, and I figured I’d share some of it here more publically.

I’d highly recommend checking out [Steve Souders](http://stevesouders.com/)’ two books:

   In the coming days/weeks, I’ll get some additional details posted about the 20 tips and tricks that I talked about, and how you can make sure you’re using them on your site!
