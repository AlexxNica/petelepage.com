<p>Usually around mid-January and mid-June, Microsoft employees do a bit of bitching.&nbsp; It's review time.&nbsp; This year is no exception, it's time to do my review, or more realistically at this time of year, the "mid year discussion".&nbsp; It's an opportunity to check in on your commitments, make sure you're in line with them, and they're in line with the companies goals.&nbsp; Because we just had a fairly major re-org, it's we also had a bit of a commitment re-org too.&nbsp; </p>
<p>One of the big commitments on the plate for my team over the coming year(s), is community.&nbsp; I've already been working on trying to up my community involvement, posting here, surfing around the MSDN forums, and a few other little tasks that I've been working on.&nbsp; But in interest of being transparent, I thought I'd post my community commitments here.&nbsp; These aren't the final ones (they still need to go up and back down the management chain), but they're pretty close.</p>
<ul>
<li>Post at least 5 community posts per week in the Forums</li>
<li>Become the community driver for the MSDN forums, encouraging people to post ASP.NET questions in the ASP.NET Forums.</li>
<li>Be able to provide information to team members about where they can get information, or help out with community. </li>
<li>Continue to blog at least once per week</li>
<li>Drive and encourage team participation in the forums and other community locations.</li>
<li>Topic for presentation selected by Mar 1, 2006</li>
<li>Presentation prepared by May 1, 2006</li>
<li>Find an opportunity to present to customers by June 30th, 2006.</li>
<li>Attend at least one customer conference, user group meeting or other similar Microsoft event</li>
<li>Post my community commitments on my blog for the community to see and comment on.</li>
</ul>
<p>There we go.&nbsp; Lemme know what you think.</p>
