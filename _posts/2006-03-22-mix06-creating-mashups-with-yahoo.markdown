<p>I remember the days when Yahoo was just a little search engine, when it was still beta and long before Search.MSN.com or Google.&nbsp; But this morning, I atteneded a session titled "<strong><em>Building Web Applications Using Yahoo! Web Services</em></strong>".&nbsp; I was very highly impressed.</p>
<p>Yahoo! is doing a lot of work to open up their API's so that you can do all kinds of searches, mapping applications, photo sharing, and all sorts of other awesome stuff.&nbsp; Most of these things are available now, but they demoed a few more that are coming, and we're going to have so much stuff that we're going to be able to use in the near future!&nbsp; I'm really excited to see where the web is going to go and where YOU are going to take it.</p>
<p>Thats the thing about the next generation internet, you, are going to be the one driving things.&nbsp; I'll provide API's and such that you can consume, and then you can build a super cool application from all sorts of different sources.&nbsp; Then, someone else can come along, plug in to your API's and improve it from there.&nbsp; And thats exactly what I'm planning on doing with my new Flickr front end.&nbsp; Or somehtinng with Flickr.&nbsp; I need to spec it out first and see where it goes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>One of my promises to you was that I'd post my community commitments and let you know how I'm doing on them.&nbsp; One of those commitments was to find a topic to present on, and prepare that presentation, and finally, find a place to present it.&nbsp; Well, I've got the topic picked, "Building Dynamic Websites Using Someone Elses API's".&nbsp; Likely the title will change, but we'll see how it goes!</p>
