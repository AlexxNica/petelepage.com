I'm sitting here on the airplane on my flight back to Seattle.  The video screens just kicked out in the last 20 minutes of my movie.  I'm on an Air Canada flight where they have the personal video screens in the back of each seat.  Nice that I can pick the movie that I want to watch, not so nice that at the climax of "The Guardian" the movie just kicks out.  Ah well, I used points for the flight so I guess I can't complain too much.  It's not like I paid for it.  But, kudo's to Air Canada for offering 120v power ports in their seats.

Ottawa was pretty great.  For those of you who came out to my talk, thanks!  It was great to see all of you.  I did a talk about standards compliance with Internet Explorer and then popped into some hands on stuff about the features of IE7 and how you can use them to enhance your website.  In fact, as part of the talk, I updated my personal website, [www.nocommonground.com](http://www.nocommonground.com/).  There are still a few things that I want to do with the site, but it's come a long way since it's last incarnation.  I need to fix a few things with the search providers, and a few things with the RSS feeds, but I should have it fixed by the end of this weekend.

I posted the slides from the presentation that I did on Wednesday night in my previous post. If your curious what I had to say, check them out.  I'm going to try to get a live meeting version of it available in the near future, but I'm not sure how long that may take.  We're also working on a series of other live meeting presentations that will have all sorts of other content about web developement on it soon.  Keep an eye on the IE blog ([http://blogs.msdn.com/ie](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie)) for more info.  We should be announcing those on either Friday or Monday, and the first one will take place on Thursday, January 11.

I think this weekend may entail a bunch of web design for me.  I teach at a school called the Photographic Center Northwest ([www.pcnw.org](http://www.pcnw.org/)) and I've promised to create a website for one of my professors there, and I've not finished it yet, so I think I want to finish that this weekend.  She has a book coming out with one of the women she works with sometime in the fall of 2007, and I offered to create a website for them.  I'll let you know when I get it up, as I really want to get it up soon, I've been procrastinating too long on this one.

Yay, the video system is back on, back to the Guardian for me.
