<p>So I made it to Orlando.  Not a big feat, but not a small feat either.  It's been a pretty good day so far, got settled in to the hotel (not as nice as I'd hoped, but hey, it's a place to stay and rest my head).  I ended up eating in the hotel restaurant tonight, and it certainly wasn't up to what I was expecting from a hotel.  The service SUCKED, and the food was only okay (at least I expected that).</p>
<p>Made it out to One Big Party tonight at Gay Days, where I met up with a coworker (not sure if he's out on his blog, so I won't link to him tonight), and we had a grand ol' time.  Off to bed now.  Tomorrow is a day of some exploring, and then Monday starts everything off!  See you all soon!</p>
