How sucky is it to wake up on the first day of 2007 not with a hang over, but a head cold!  Well, from personal experience, it's not much fun.  And I'm home in Seattle where I could just turn on the fireplace (it's electric), and curl up and watch TV.  I'm up in Ottawa, where I got to spend a great New Years Eve with some good friends.  I'm staying for a few extra days to do a user group presentation on IE.

If you're in Ottawa, or know anyone in Ottawa, let them know, it should be really interesting.  I'm going to talk a bit, then really dig into some fun code.  I've included the description of the session below, along with the registration info.  I'll post the slide deck tomorrow after the presentation.
