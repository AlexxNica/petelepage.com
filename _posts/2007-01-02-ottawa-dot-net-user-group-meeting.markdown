<p>How sucky is it to wake up on the first day of 2007 not with a hang over, but a head cold!  Well, from personal experience, it's not much fun.  And I'm home in Seattle where I could just turn on the fireplace (it's electric), and curl up and watch TV.  I'm up in Ottawa, where I got to spend a great New Years Eve with some good friends.  I'm staying for a few extra days to do a user group presentation on IE.</p>
<p>If you're in Ottawa, or know anyone in Ottawa, let them know, it should be really interesting.  I'm going to talk a bit, then really dig into some fun code.  I've included the description of the session below, along with the registration info.  I'll post the slide deck tomorrow after the presentation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Consolas;">Internet Explorer 7 took us over 5 years to get out the door, we'll look at why it took us so long, and some of the challenges that the IE team faced in making sure IE7 was more standards compliant, and didn't break "the Internet".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>After that brief introduction, we'll look at some of the new features of IE7 and how you can use those to drive traffic to your site, and create a better user experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></span></p>
</blockquote>
