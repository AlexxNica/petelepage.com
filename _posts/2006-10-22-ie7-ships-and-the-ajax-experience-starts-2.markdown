<p>Wow, what a week it's been.&nbsp; It's funny, I remember when <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/keiths/" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/keiths/">Keith</a> moved upstairs to marketing, I watched him blog, and I watched the number of posts he made slowly taper off to where he posts a once a month or so.&nbsp; I said to myself, I wasn't going to let that happen to me ever.&nbsp; I'd always find the time to blog.&nbsp; Well, I can safely say, that isn't as easy as I'd thought!&nbsp; I'm way behind in my blogging these days, which irks me.&nbsp; Blogging about work stuff is a fun way for me to share, and help make Microsoft a more open, and transparent company.&nbsp; If you know what is coming, and can have some say in the way it comes, you will hopefully trust it more, and have a bit of ownership in it.&nbsp; Or at least, you'll understand why we fixed one bug over another.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Last week we <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/10/18/internet-explorer-7-for-windows-xp-available-now.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/10/18/internet-explorer-7-for-windows-xp-available-now.aspx">launched</a>, which was awesome.&nbsp; I went down to San Francisco to meet with a bunch of pretty influential bloggers, and it was a very neat crowd.&nbsp; I learned a lot of interesting stuff, heard lots of feedback, and generally met some cool people.&nbsp; It was a little weird to me to see some bloggers writing down my comments for future writings, which freaked me out a little bit at first, but then when I thought about it, that's my job.&nbsp; I speak about IE, and I listen to comments about IE.&nbsp; Most of the people there were developers, and all had gripes, but many said thanks, you've taken a step to make my life a bit easier.&nbsp; Oh, and when is IE.next coming out?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Everyone wants to hear us say, and I think we need to keep saying, we are committed to this.&nbsp; IE has come back, the "vacation" is over, we're taking feedback for IE.next today.&nbsp; There isn't a formal loop for feedback yet, but we're working on it.&nbsp; At this point in the process, our big steps are not creating major feature scenarios, or anything like that, but to look at the simple feature requests, and start prioritizing those.&nbsp; What do people want IE to do?&nbsp; What do they want us to do better.&nbsp; We know there is a lot, and you've certainly told us there is a lot.&nbsp; Start thinking about a top 10 list of the 10 things you want to see happen in IE.next for the developer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>After getting home from San Francisco, I had two nights in my own bed before I took off to Boston for <a href="http://www.theajaxexperience.com/" mce_href="http://www.theajaxexperience.com/">The Ajax Experience</a>.&nbsp; I came out an extra day early so I could make sure all our packages arrived, set up our booth and so forth.&nbsp; Needless to say, it was a good thing I did.&nbsp; They lost my luggage on the flight, but thankfully I got that back at 7:30am this morning.&nbsp; Then, of the 8 or so boxes we had shipped here, we found the first four easily.&nbsp; Then I had to call down an enquire about the other 4.&nbsp; They managed to find 2 more, but couldn't find the last two.&nbsp; CRAP!&nbsp; These last two are the major part of our display for the booth we've got.&nbsp; It took me until almost mid-day today to find the last two, it seems like they mis-labeled them, and put them in the wrong place.&nbsp; We're staying at the <a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/westin/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1528" mce_href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/westin/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1528">Westin Boston Waterfront</a>, and it's&nbsp;a brand new hotel, and it is showing a few signs of that, for example, when I got to my room, some how, the bathroom had been used before I got there!&nbsp; There was a towel on the floor, the sink was dirty, and the there was a used soap bar in the sink!&nbsp; Eek!&nbsp; The internet connection has also been WAY spottier than it should be.</p>

<p>What else, OH YAH!&nbsp; I got my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/10/20/building-add-ons-for-ie-could-net-you-a-trip-to-mix07-and-2500.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/10/20/building-add-ons-for-ie-could-net-you-a-trip-to-mix07-and-2500.aspx">first blog post on the IE Blog</a>!&nbsp; It's pretty cool, but I got to announce the AddOn contest for IE.&nbsp; check out the post, but the short answer is if you submit an AddOn to the IE AddOns website between November 1st 2006 and February 9th 2007, we'll pick a few of the best ones and send one winner to Mix07 and give them $2500.&nbsp; We've got some other cool prizes, including $2000, $1000, $500 and a couple of Zunes.&nbsp; Check out the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/10/20/building-add-ons-for-ie-could-net-you-a-trip-to-mix07-and-2500.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/10/20/building-add-ons-for-ie-could-net-you-a-trip-to-mix07-and-2500.aspx">announcement</a>!</p>
<p>Anyways, I should get to bed, I need to set up the XBOX lounge around 7:30am tomorrow.&nbsp; </p>
