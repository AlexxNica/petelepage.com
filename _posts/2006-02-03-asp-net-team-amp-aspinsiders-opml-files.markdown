<p>Yesterday, someone on one of the mailing lists that I'm on asked if there was an <a href="http://www.opml.org/">OPML</a> file for the members of the <a href="http://www.aspinsiders.net/">ASPInsiders</a> group.&nbsp; I've been reading all of the ASPInsiders blogs for some time, mostly to see what they're saying, and take their comments to heart.</p>
<p>I also read the blogs of several fellow&nbsp;MSFT employees, so I figured why not "publish" the OPML files that I use to track all of these people</p>
<p>So!</p>
<p><u><font color="#800080"><a href="http://www.nocommonground.com/blogSamples/OPML/insiders.xml">http://www.nocommonground.com/blogSamples/OPML/insiders.xml</a></font></u></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nocommonground.com/blogSamples/OPML/wpt.xml">http://www.nocommonground.com/blogSamples/OPML/wpt.xml</a></p>
<p>The files are actually OPML, but for some reason my ISP isn't letting me serve OPML files, and is returning 404 errors.&nbsp; I'll work with them to get that fixed, but in the mean time, if you're interested in the blogs of the ASPInsiders or Web Platform and Tools folk, check out the OPML's.</p>
