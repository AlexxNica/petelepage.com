Due to some manufacturing problems, we just got our **Visual Web Developer Express DVD's** this morning. If you're looking for a copy of VWD, you can get them either at the Web Cabana or the Pavillion. 

The disks are pretty awesome, complete with VWD 2005 Beta2, SQL Server Express 2005 Beta2, and lots of learning tools. This is a great way to get up to speed if you haven't already seen it!
