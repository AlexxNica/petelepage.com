<p><img src="http://www.bigbackpack.ca/nGallery/photos/83/4/140x134.aspx" align="left"/><br />Due to some manufacturing problems, we just got our <b>Visual Web Developer Express DVD's</b> this morning. If you're looking for a copy of VWD, you can get them either at the Web Cabana or the Pavillion. </p>
<p>The disks are pretty awesome, complete with VWD 2005 Beta2, SQL Server Express 2005 Beta2, and lots of learning tools. This is a great way to get up to speed if you haven't already seen it!</p>
