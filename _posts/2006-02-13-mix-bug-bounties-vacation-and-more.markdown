Well, I'm back from Vacation and feeling absolutely FAN-FREAKIN-TASTIC!&nbsp; I did absolutely nothing while sitting on the beach and beside the pool in Ixtapa, Mexico.&nbsp; And I gotta say, it was out of this world.&nbsp; I've not felt so relaxed and ready to come to work in a while.&nbsp; That was much needed!!

Before I left, I had announced a Bug Bounty, and thanks to [Raj Kaimal](http://weblogs.asp.net/rajbk/), I got repro steps for the bug!&nbsp; I handed it off to the devs before I left, and to much to my satisfaction, when I got back, there was an email in my inbox letting me know that the dev's had fixed the bug!&nbsp; So, hopefully that'll mean we'll see it in the service pack when it comes out!&nbsp; So, special thanks to Raj and his friend for their hard work!

The cool thing about this whole bug bounty, I talked to my lead, some marketing guys, and a few other important people, and it looks like we might be rolling this out officially for Orcas!&nbsp; No promises yet, but it looks like both the design time and the run time team are going to participate, and we'll have a special site for you to help us out.&nbsp; The prizes will be varied, and and likely you'll get some choice in what you get.&nbsp; We're still figuring out all the details, but this is a great way to get you involved, and help us out with some of those hard to repro bugs!

[Mix 06](http://www.mix06.com) is coming up!&nbsp; I'm really excited about it.&nbsp; I really want to go, but not sure what if I'm going to be able to yet.&nbsp; They're strictly limiting the number of MS folk so as to make it more a conversation about web technologies, not just a Microsoft technology type conference like PDC or TechEd.&nbsp; The idea being that there are plenty of people there other than just MS staff.&nbsp; eBay, Amazon and other big name web companies are big participants, so it should be pretty awesome.&nbsp; Check it out, if you can go, I'd highly recommend it.&nbsp; I think this is going to be the conference to be at this year.
