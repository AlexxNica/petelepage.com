Two quick notes that I wanted to get out there.

IE8.  Yep, it officially has a name now.  Check out the [post](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/12/05/internet-explorer-8.aspx) from Dean on the IE blog.

I've uploaded the new VPC images and am just waiting for them to propagate through the severs, now.  I expect it to be live within the next 24 hours.
