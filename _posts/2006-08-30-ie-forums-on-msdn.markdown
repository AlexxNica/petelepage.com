Finally, a place to ask [web development questions](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/default.aspx?ForumGroupID=253&amp;SiteID=1) on the MSDN Forums!

Today, we launched two new forums on MSDN, [Internet Explorer Web Development](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=923&amp;SiteID=1), for discussions about HTML, CSS, and script for IE.  The second one [Internet Explorer Extension Development](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=924&amp;SiteID=1), is for those who are creating Add-On's for Internet Explorer.

There isn't much in there right now, a post welcome post from [Dave Massy](http://blogs.msdn.com/dmassy), one of the great PM's on the IE team.  As questions are asked, we're working to get people from the IE development team in there to answer them, so fire away!
