<p>I think the biggest question people asked about the IE6 VPC image was when will it be available?</p>
<p>How about right now!</p>
<p>After a rather late night last night, and a bit of a false start, I uploaded the VPC image this morning, and it's gone live.&nbsp; The image contains Windows XP SP2, IE6 and the IE7 Readiness Toolkit.&nbsp; It clocks in at a 496meg download, and unpacks to about 1.5 gigs.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=70868">Internet Explorer 6 Application Compatibility VPC Image</a>
<p>The image is set to expire on April 1, 2007 (it's not an April Fools Joke).&nbsp; If there is enough demand, we'll most likely release another one in March some time, and extend the expiry date.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I'll make another post later today with a link to the IE Blog post about this with more info.</p>
