<p>I presented this session both in Amsterdam and in Zürich, though I managed to lose my notes in Zürich and had do to a number of the demo's by the seat of my pants which was a bit of a challenge.</p>
<p>In any event, it was based on a session by Omar Khan of the VWD team that he presented at MIX07, called "<a href="http://sessions.visitmix.com/default.asp?event=1011&amp;session=2012&amp;pid=DEV14&amp;disc=&amp;id=1523&amp;year=2007&amp;search=DEV14">Using Visual Studio Codename Orcas to Design And Devloper Rich AJAX Enable Web Sites</a>"</p>
