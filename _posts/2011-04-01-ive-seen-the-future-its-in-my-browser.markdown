    Keep up the excellent work! The Chrome Web Store and Chrome OS philosophy are some of my biggest motivators recently.

    Is that a new icon for the CWS? Will we see it soon?

  content: By the way HTML5rocks is the best HTML5 resource for a good country mile
    (not including the HTML5 Boilerplate, I mean more in a tutorial sense.) It's my
    go-to site for learning and implementing any of the awesome new APIs, like local
    storage, notifications, etc. Tell those guys THEY rock!

<p>Within a week, the movers showed up to pack my condo and help me move south to San Francisco.&#160; A new challenge was awaiting me there, and something I’m really passionate and excited about.&#160; Today will mark the end of week three at Google as a Developer Advocate on the Chrome Web Store team.&#160; </p>
<p>There are a lot of aspects of the role that drew me to it and have excited to go into work every morning - for example, I get to write code again! I’m an engineer at heart, and would much rather write JavaScript than a value proposition.&#160; Heck, I’d rather write low level assembly than write another value propositions again!&#160; I get to participate in community events, conferences, hack-a-thons and meet ups (PS - if you’re looking for a speaker for an event, let me know)!&#160; But most importantly, I get to work directly with the web developer community to build awesome new web applications using open web technologies like HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
<p>I’ve been really amazed with the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/petele/chromedevrel-11">Chrome Developer Relations team</a> - they’re absolutely brilliant and I’ll learn a lot from them (hopefully they’ll learn stuff once I get over the information overload of the new guy on the team).&#160;&#160; If you haven’t already, check out <a href="http://html5rocks.com/">http://html5rocks.com</a>, I sit within about a dozen feet of the guys who built it – not the agency, but the real people who did the work and keep the site up to date, adding new and fresh content all the time.&#160; The site is a great jumping off place for all things HTML5, and includes an overview of what’s in HTML5 (through the <a href="http://slides.html5rocks.com">slides</a>), as well as all kinds of cool tutorials, and a code playground.&#160; I’ve started writing my first tutorial on device orientation and hope to have it up shortly! </p>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="cws" border="0" alt="cws" align="right" src="http://petelepage.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/cws.png" width="103" height="127" /></a>I admit that when I started I didn’t really know or understand the purpose of the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web Store</a>, but as I talked to the team, and learned more about what we are trying to accomplish, I realized that it’s just another mechanism for web developers to use to get their web applications out there and used by people like my Mom.&#160; It’s not about a pay wall, or browser war, but it’s about making great web experiences easier to find, giving developers a great distribution model, and putting your web applications in front of more than 120 million Chrome users world wide.</p>
<p>If you want to put your web application into the Chrome Web Store, there’s a great tutorial at <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/webstore/docs/get_started_simple.html">http://code.google.com/chrome/webstore/docs/get_started_simple.html</a> that will walk you through everything you need to do.&#160; Basically, you create an application manifest file (a single JSON file), package a couple of icons in there, zip it up, and upload it to the Chrome Web Store.&#160; If you’ve already got a cool web app and want to get it in front of more people, this is another great opportunity!</p>
<p>If you haven’t started playing with HTML5 yet, it’s definitely time to start - there are a bunch of great tutorials on HTML5Rocks at <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/">http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/</a>.&#160; And also check out Paul Irish’s <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boiler Plate</a>, I’ve used it quite a bit on a couple of projects so far, and it’s super helpful.&#160; And if you’re looking for inspiration - and want to see what’s possible with HTML5, check out <a href="http://makeawesomeweb.com/">http://makeawesomeweb.com/</a></p>

<p>PS - the Google campus, aaaa-mazing!&#160; But I’ll save that for another post later!</p>
<p>PPS - Happy April Fools Day, I don’t know what the joke will be today, but I’m excited to find out!!</p>
