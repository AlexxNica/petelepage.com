I just finished presenting my last session of TechEd EMEA for 2008 and I'm sad to be leaving!  But, hopefully I'll get another chance next year.

My last session was a repeat of "Top 10 Web Mistakes" and I said I'd post some of the sites that I showed during the session, so here they are.

**Sites That Suck**

How am I supposed to find content on this site?

Some validation errors are okay, others, maybe not so much.

I don't even know where to start, figuratively or literally.

Nice to see consistency on here. :)

Only pop ups?  Really?

Think about your work flow.

Try turning JavaScript off and count the clicks to a 404.

A little too much flash for me.

Hmm, ad too much?

Let's find a creative way of putting ads on a page.

If only there were a group like Doctors Without Boarders, Designers Without Boarders.

GREAT use of isolating hacks!

Thanks for a great time in Barcelona!
