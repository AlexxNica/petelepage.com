<p>I've posted about it before, but there's a bug in VS2005 that is driving me nuts.&nbsp; Sometimes, when attempting to rename a webcontrol from the property grid,&nbsp;the rename fails with an error dialog that says "If you have references in mark up, they will not be renamed. Do you want to continue? [Yes] [No]"&nbsp; No matter what button you press, the rename fails.</p>
<p>I've spent the better part of this afternoon trying to get this bug to repro for me, and get clear concise, REPRODUCABLE repro steps so I can file the bug and get a dev to look at it.&nbsp; But I haven't been able to get it.</p>
<p>Here's where you come in.&nbsp; If you can get me 100% reproducable steps (and it works for me), I've got "Ready To Launch" software package for you.&nbsp; It includes VS 2005 Standard Edition, SQL Server 2005 Standard Edition (1 CAL), a copy of BizTalk 2006, an exam voucher for a an MS certification exam.&nbsp; And I'll find something else to go along with it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I want this bug found!</p>
