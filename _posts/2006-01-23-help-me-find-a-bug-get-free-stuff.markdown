I've posted about it before, but there's a bug in VS2005 that is driving me nuts.&nbsp; Sometimes, when attempting to rename a webcontrol from the property grid,&nbsp;the rename fails with an error dialog that says "If you have references in mark up, they will not be renamed. Do you want to continue? [Yes] [No]"&nbsp; No matter what button you press, the rename fails.

I've spent the better part of this afternoon trying to get this bug to repro for me, and get clear concise, REPRODUCABLE repro steps so I can file the bug and get a dev to look at it.&nbsp; But I haven't been able to get it.

Here's where you come in.&nbsp; If you can get me 100% reproducable steps (and it works for me), I've got "Ready To Launch" software package for you.&nbsp; It includes VS 2005 Standard Edition, SQL Server 2005 Standard Edition (1 CAL), a copy of BizTalk 2006, an exam voucher for a an MS certification exam.&nbsp; And I'll find something else to go along with it.&nbsp; 

I want this bug found!
