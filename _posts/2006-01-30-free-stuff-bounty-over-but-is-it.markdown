<p><a href="/petel/archive/2006/01/23/516585.aspx">Last week I posted a bounty on a bug</a>, and I'm happy to report that I've got repro steps!&nbsp; But I don't have the common user scenario yet, so I'm leaving the bounty open.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So, the bounty is still open, if you can get me repro steps to get the bug to happen, I've got a copy of the ship software and a team t-shirt for you.&nbsp; I'm adding one "catch" into this though, no "funky" business, you can't delete things while working or anything like that.</p>
