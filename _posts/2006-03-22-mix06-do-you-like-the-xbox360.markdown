Sadly, today was the last day of Mix06, and things started winding down this morning.&nbsp; I think the coolest thing I saw this afternoon though, was when the Channel 9 team (or was it ten) came by the XBox station that I was manning and asked if they could interview the couple of guys who were still there playing.&nbsp; Now remember, this is the end of the conference, most people have left, and instead of the 12-15 people that were normally congregated around the xbox, there were only two.

The interview went kind of like this:
Interviewer: Did you like the conference?
Gamer: Yeah, it was really cool...
I: How about the 360 lounges?
G: They rocked, it was a great place to go and wind down for a few minutes...
I: Do you have a 360 at home?
G: No...
I: Do you want this one?
Face of gamer lights up!

Yep!&nbsp; They gave away the three XBoxes that were at Mix06!!&nbsp; Crazy!&nbsp; These guys were really happy, and one, I guess not much of a Microsoft fan said he never imagined how much he'd come to like the some of the stuff we're doing, and that he was getting an XBOX!

Congrats to those three!
