<p>Sadly, today was the last day of Mix06, and things started winding down this morning.&nbsp; I think the coolest thing I saw this afternoon though, was when the Channel 9 team (or was it ten) came by the XBox station that I was manning and asked if they could interview the couple of guys who were still there playing.&nbsp; Now remember, this is the end of the conference, most people have left, and instead of the 12-15 people that were normally congregated around the xbox, there were only two.</p>
<p>The interview went kind of like this:<br />Interviewer: Did you like the conference?<br />Gamer: Yeah, it was really cool...<br />I: How about the 360 lounges?<br />G: They rocked, it was a great place to go and wind down for a few minutes...<br />I: Do you have a 360 at home?<br />G: No...<br />I: Do you want this one?<br />Face of gamer lights up!</p>
<p>Yep!&nbsp; They gave away the three XBoxes that were at Mix06!!&nbsp; Crazy!&nbsp; These guys were really happy, and one, I guess not much of a Microsoft fan said he never imagined how much he'd come to like the some of the stuff we're doing, and that he was getting an XBOX!</p>
<p>Congrats to those three!</p>
