Like [Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu) (our GM) I spend a bit of time every day reading blogs, and surfing forums.&nbsp; I usually surf the MSDN forums and find ASP.NET related posts, and redirect these people over to the ASP.NET fourms.&nbsp; While doing that, I try to give them a enough of an answer to get them going, but not enough to move the topic off subject.&nbsp; Over the last few months, I've been collecting a bunch of references that I thought I'd share here so that you can easily find it.

[Membership, Roles, Forms Authentication, Security Resources](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/02/24/438953.aspx)

[Web Deployment Projects](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/02/12/438060.aspx)

[Atlas (Ajax) For ASP.NET](http://atlas.asp.net)

[Run Built In WebServer From Root "/"](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/11/21/431138.aspx)
