<p>At TechEd this year, I presented a session where I presented my top five pet peeves on the web, the biggest and easiest problems to avoid on the web.  With how easy it is to share content on the web, I felt that these top five things were the best and easiest to get rid of.</p>
<p>In order, I felt they were:</p>
<p>5.  Unprofessional Site Design<br />
4.  Lousy Content<br />
3.  Poorly coded HTML/CSS/JavaScript<br />
2.  Inappropriate use of Rich Content<br />
1.  Not Being POSH</p>
<p>I've attached my slides below, so check them out, and let me know what your pet peeves are!</p>
