At TechEd this year, I presented a session where I presented my top five pet peeves on the web, the biggest and easiest problems to avoid on the web.  With how easy it is to share content on the web, I felt that these top five things were the best and easiest to get rid of.

In order, I felt they were:

5.  Unprofessional Site Design

4.  Lousy Content

3.  Poorly coded HTML/CSS/JavaScript

2.  Inappropriate use of Rich Content

1.  Not Being POSH

I've attached my slides below, so check them out, and let me know what your pet peeves are!
