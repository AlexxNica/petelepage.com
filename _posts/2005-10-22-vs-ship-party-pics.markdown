Yesterday was a pretty good day, my team signed off on VS 2005 and we had our ship party.  The party wasn't quite as exciting as previous ship parties, but it was still a darn good time.  

I've posted my pictures up online at [http://www.bigbackpack.ca/nGallery/albums/VS+2005+Ship+Party.aspx](http://www.bigbackpack.ca/nGallery/albums/VS+2005+Ship+Party.aspx) for all to see.  Most of those people in the pictures are Visual Web Developer team members.  Most of us were in costume and having a good time.  I was the bag of Jelly Belly's.  I think the only ones I have of me in costume are of my wardrobe malfunction.  Ah well.
