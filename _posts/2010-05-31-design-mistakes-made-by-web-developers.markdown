  content: "Favourite site...hmm...my own...needs a designer :)\r\n\r\nOne I use that
    is probably not well known is an Australian one called whirlpool.net.au (a tech
    forum). Aesthetically it is good looking, but, the search. It's in the wrong spot.
    Difficult to find. It's like....slap head, this should be obvious."

I mentioned in a previous blog post that I’m doing one of my favorite sessions at TechEd again this year – Top 10 Design Mistakes Made By Web Developers. I would consider myself a web developer, not so much a web designer. I can make something that doesn’t look bad, but it’s typically doesn’t have the same shine that a good web designer can do.

> We've all seen those sites where it's obvious the developer didn't consult a designer. There's no user experience flow, the colors clash, you don’t quite know what to do on the site. During this session, we take a look at the top mistakes made by Web developers when they don't have access to Web designers; and hopefully learn a few techniques for making sure your sites look great!

I feel guilty listing the non-Microsoft sites here because I don’t really want to call anyone out in public, so instead, I’ll share a few of my “favorite” Microsoft sites. If you make it to my TechEd session, I promise to make you laugh or maybe cry…

What are your favorite sites (either Microsoft or not) that you think think need the help of a good web designer?
