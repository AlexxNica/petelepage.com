One of the great things I love about my job is the ability to help make the lives of Developers easier, seeing things change and helping others to get the tools and resources they need to get shit done, to put it bluntly.

I've spent the last few days talking to the PUM (product unit manager) of the JavaScript team about the changes that they have coming for IE.Next, and where the JavaScript engine is going.  It's a fascinating discussion, and there are some really awesome things lined up for the next version of IE.Next.  In any event, he is looking for two people to help staff up his team.  A senior program manager, and a senior developer.  The PM role is based here in Redmond, and the dev role may be flexible between here and India.  I've attached the job descriptions below.  If you're interested, you should email [shreeshd@microsoft.com](mailto:shreeshd@microsoft.com)

## Senior Developer - JavaScript

With the rapid adoption and innovation around AJAX and extensive use of JavaScript™, several teams within MS (Visual Studio, Internet Explorer, CLR and other language teams) are defining and building next generation of tools and technologies to innovate around this new development paradigm.  This position provides a unique and highly visible opportunity to be in the middle of this exciting transition. The Developer Division’s Languages and Tools Group in IDC is staffing up a team to get focused around JScript and evolve it to the next generation dynamic language.   The specific charter of the team is the next version of JScript (Microsoft implementation of JavaScript™), but the role extends far beyond this and into interfacing with the innovations in the CLR, the new dynamic runtime, Internet Explorer and building world class developer tools for JScript.

We are looking for a software development engineer with very strong domain knowledge in the area of languages and tools to develop the next generation of JScript and related tooling to develop cutting edge WEB2.0 AJAX applications.  You will also help define Microsoft’s strategy in the ECMA Standards body that is evolving the JavaScript™ language as a standard for AJAX development. You will interface with several internal groups like the CLR team, Atlas, Internet Explorer, Visual Studio, and Visual Web Developer as well as with key JScript customers such as OWA, Windows Live etc. to understand market requirements and drive innovations in the JScript language and tooling requirements for JScript.   The JScript Product Unit team is located in IDC, and there will be a senior PM as well as a senior architect located in Redmond for this team. While it is preferred for this position to be in IDC Hyderabad, depending on seniority and extent of domain knowledge and expertise, job location can be flexible.

Candidates must exhibit excellent communication, be highly motivated and self driven. Domain knowledge in dynamic scripting languages and a proven track record for building runtimes, compilers or tooling for dynamic or static languages is a requirement. Developing large AJAX application and familiarity with the challenges in this domain is a strong PLUS. This is a hands-on position that requires design, development and extensive coding so programming skills need to be current and excellent. Qualifications include strong (at least 10 years experience) software development skills in the related domain. A BS/MS degree in Computer Science or related technical field is required.
