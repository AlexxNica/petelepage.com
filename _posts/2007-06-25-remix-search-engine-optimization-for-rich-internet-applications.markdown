I think that this was my favorite session I did while doing all my ReMIX presentations.  It was the one I found most interesting, and most relevant to the work that I do, and see many web developers and designers doing every day.

I'm not sure if there is video for this session, but if it shows up, I'll be sure to link to it.  In the mean time, I've included the slides for you to check out, and I'll try to get a blog post out about in the next week or two summarizing the info in the deck.
