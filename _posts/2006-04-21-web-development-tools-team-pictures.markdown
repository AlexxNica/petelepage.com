Earlier this week we shot some photos of the team to put on our new team blog (I'll post about that later this afternoon once we get our first post on it), but I have a few frames left.&nbsp; Yep, good 'ol film!&nbsp; I'm a bit of a film snob.&nbsp; 

One of the photos I took to finish off the roll was of Lan and Rachel working on some code reviews.&nbsp; It turned out rather nicely, so I thought I'd share.

There is also the team photo.&nbsp; Though there are a few people missing, this is the majority of the team.
