While at lunch today, we got on to the conversation of web design and web development resources.  I have sitting on my desk at all times, well, unless I'm using them at home:

*   [Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide](http://www.amazon.com/Cascading-Style-Sheets-Definitive-Guide/dp/0596005253/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-1378970-2441539?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1177364422&amp;sr=8-1) by [Eric Meyer](http://meyerweb.com/)
*   [Web Standards Solutions: The Markup and Style Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/Web-Standards-Solutions-Handbook-Pioneering/dp/1590593812/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-1378970-2441539?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1177364452&amp;sr=1-1) by [Dan Cederholm](http://simplebits.com/about/dan/)
*   [Web Design Index 5](http://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-Index/dp/9057680688/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-1378970-2441539?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1177364482&amp;sr=1-1) from [The Pepin Press](http://www.pepinpress.com/)

I've got a few other books that I keep handy, though I'm noticeably missing an HTML book, and a copy of the W3C CSS 2.1 spec.

I've got a few websites that I like to keep an eye on for resources, for example, color charts, HTML escape sequences, and such.

What about you, what are your favorite sites/books?  What's sitting on your desk?
