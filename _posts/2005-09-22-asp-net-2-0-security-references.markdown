<p>I don't like posting links to generic references all that often, though, I do admit to doing it here and there, but this is one that I thought was worth while for anyone who does any kind of ASP.NET development.&nbsp; Sure, it doesn't really make your website look pretty, but it'll help keep your website up, and well, in business, and thats kind of important.</p>

<p>But here is another hint, that is kind of important.&nbsp; VS2005 will automatically open and compile any web project you open.&nbsp; So that "sample" application you download from the web, well, it does have potential to do damage to your system.&nbsp; So what can you do to protect yourself?&nbsp; Well, first, make sure you are only downloading from reputable sites, and stuff that you know what it does.&nbsp; Second, you should NEVER run as admin on your box.&nbsp; Well, okay, never is a strong word, but generally,&nbsp;you shouldn't run as an admin on your box for your day to day work.&nbsp; This will help protect your system from all sorts of nasty things.&nbsp; When I set computers up for families and friends these days, I usually don't even give them the admin password on the box.&nbsp; I just tell them to contact me if they run into problems.&nbsp; The support cost to me is aobut the same - if they need to install something they call, but it's better than them calling because they've been infected with spyware.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It looks like we're going to get an escrow build tonight!&nbsp; Yay!</p>
<p>Company meeting tomorrow! Yay!</p>
