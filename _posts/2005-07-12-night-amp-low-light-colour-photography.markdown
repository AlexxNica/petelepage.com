<p>The one on my left is my favourite I think.&nbsp; The scan doesn't really do justice to the colour of the sky, but its this wonderful royal blue.&nbsp; When I shot this negative, it was about an 8 minute exposure, and the sky was, as far as I could tell, completely black, but when you leave the shutter open for so long, you get great colours.</p>
