![](http://www.bigbackpack.ca/nGallery/photos/98/10/244x240.aspx)This quarter I'm taking a night, and low light colour photography class at school and its been pretty cool so far.&nbsp; I've shot about 6 rolls of film, and by far, these last two are the best I've picked up yet.&nbsp; These are just scans of the negatives, I haven't had a chance to print them yet, so we'll see how that goes.&nbsp; 

The one on my left is my favourite I think.&nbsp; The scan doesn't really do justice to the colour of the sky, but its this wonderful royal blue.&nbsp; When I shot this negative, it was about an 8 minute exposure, and the sky was, as far as I could tell, completely black, but when you leave the shutter open for so long, you get great colours.
