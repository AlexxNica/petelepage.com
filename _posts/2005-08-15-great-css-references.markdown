There was a [story](http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/08/15/0051234&amp;tid=95&amp;tid=8) this morning on [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org) talking about the test best resources for CSS and I wanted to link to the story and post a few of the links here for future reference.&nbsp; The original story is at [http://www.sitepronews.com/archives/2005/july/20.html](http://www.sitepronews.com/archives/2005/july/20.html)&nbsp;

On a completely different note, they fixed one of the valves in the HVAC system this weekend, and I walked into my office, and I think it's about 55Â°F in here right now. I've got a fleece on,and I'm tempted to root through my "schwag" box to see if I can find something else to put on.&nbsp; Thankfully I rarely wear shorts to work so I've got pants on today, cause if I did wear shorts, I would be here today!
