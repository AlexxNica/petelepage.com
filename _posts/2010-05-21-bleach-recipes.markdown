The following bleaches work well for different things and are pretty useful. The

receipies are all for "stock" solutions, not working solutions. See the section

on bleaching for making working dilutions.

## Potassium Ferrocyanide (Stock)

Keeps indefinitely in dark brown bottle.

10 g Potassium Ferrocyanide

100 ml water

## Thiocarbamide 'dry' Reducer (Stock)

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Solution A:</p>

2.3g Iodine

50ml Mthyl alcohol</td>
<td>Solution B:

4.6g Thiocarbamide

50ml warm water</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Mix equal parts A &amp; B just before use. To use, apply with a fine brush and swab off with methyl alcohol. Precautions should be taken using this bleach as its highly flammable, and not good for you, so wear gloves, and never smoke around it. Put prints directly into fresh fixer without rinsing to make bleaching effect permanent.

## Dichromate Intensifying Bleach (Stock)

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Solution A:</p>

10ml Potassium dichromate</td>
<td>Solution B:

10ml Hydrochloric acid (10%)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Mix 1 part A to 1 part b to 6 parts water.

## Cupric Sulphate Bleach (Stock)

50g Cupric sulphate

6.5ml sulphuric acid concentrate

50g Sodium chloride

water to make 1000ml.
