I just heard the Dev track here in Ottawa is so full that people are sitting on the floor!&nbsp; There are so many people who want to see the Dev Track presentations that they are actually having to turn people away at the door now!&nbsp; That's how exciting these launch events are!&nbsp; 

I said yesterday that I would try to post some answers to the frequently asked question from the Cabana's, and since I've got a minute or two, I figured I'd post a few answers.

**ASP Classic to ASP.NET Migration**

There are a couple of tools available, and the best place to start is the MSDN website at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/migration/aspmig/aspmigasst/default.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/migration/aspmig/aspmigasst/default.aspx)

**Atlas and AJAX**

What the heck is Atlas?&nbsp; It's the Microsoft ASP.NET representation of AJAX.&nbsp; Check out [http://atlas.asp.net/](http://atlas.asp.net/)&nbsp;for some great stuff, including a beta of Atlas for ASP.NET 2.0

**WebParts In ASP.NET 2.0 and SharePoint Server**

*   ASP.NET 2.0 Web Parts will run on SharePoint Server with a 3rd party tool
*   SharePoint Web Parts will run ASP.NET 2.0
*   ASP.NET 2.0 Web Parts will run on the next version of SharePoint Server (called Windows Sharepoint Server)

There are some great photos and other blogs about the event!&nbsp; Check out [http://blogs.msdn.com/mark_relph/default.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/mark_relph/default.aspx)&nbsp;as a great place to start.
