<p>I just heard the Dev track here in Ottawa is so full that people are sitting on the floor!&nbsp; There are so many people who want to see the Dev Track presentations that they are actually having to turn people away at the door now!&nbsp; That's how exciting these launch events are!&nbsp; </p>
<p>I said yesterday that I would try to post some answers to the frequently asked question from the Cabana's, and since I've got a minute or two, I figured I'd post a few answers.</p>
<p><strong>ASP Classic to ASP.NET Migration</strong></p>
<p>There are a couple of tools available, and the best place to start is the MSDN website at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/migration/aspmig/aspmigasst/default.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/migration/aspmig/aspmigasst/default.aspx</a></p>
<p><strong>Atlas and AJAX</strong></p>
<p>What the heck is Atlas?&nbsp; It's the Microsoft ASP.NET representation of AJAX.&nbsp; Check out <a href="http://atlas.asp.net/">http://atlas.asp.net/</a>&nbsp;for some great stuff, including a beta of Atlas for ASP.NET 2.0</p>
<p><strong>WebParts In ASP.NET 2.0 and SharePoint Server</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ASP.NET 2.0 Web Parts will run on SharePoint Server with a 3rd party tool</li>
<li>SharePoint Web Parts will run ASP.NET 2.0</li>
<li>ASP.NET 2.0 Web Parts will run on the next version of SharePoint Server (called Windows Sharepoint Server)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some great photos and other blogs about the event!&nbsp; Check out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mark_relph/default.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/mark_relph/default.aspx</a>&nbsp;as a great place to start.</p>
