<p>As I was getting ready this morning, I realized something kind of cool, and at the same time, a little scary.</p>
<p>The last launch event I was at, I was in my teens, just finishing up high school, and working for Microosft as a high school intern.  It was the Windows 95 launch at the base of the CN Tower in 1995.  10 years ago.  </p>
<p>So, 10 years later, I'm about to get on an airplane and head to Toronto again for a launch event. </p>
<p>Crazyness!</p>
