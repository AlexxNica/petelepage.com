As I was getting ready this morning, I realized something kind of cool, and at the same time, a little scary.

The last launch event I was at, I was in my teens, just finishing up high school, and working for Microosft as a high school intern.  It was the Windows 95 launch at the base of the CN Tower in 1995.  10 years ago.  

So, 10 years later, I'm about to get on an airplane and head to Toronto again for a launch event. 

Crazyness!
