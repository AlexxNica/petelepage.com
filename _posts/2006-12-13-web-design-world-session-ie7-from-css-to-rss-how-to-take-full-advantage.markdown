I just finished my session titled "Internet Explorer 7 From CSS to RSS: How To Take Full Advantage" here at Web Design World, and it went over pretty well.  Cameron Moll is currently doing a session right now, so we did lose quite a few people to him, but he's an excellent speaker and is showing some really cool CSS and design stuff, so I understand why they're over there.

I talked about some of the cool features around IE7, like what quirks mode is vs. standards mode; how to use RSS on your site, how to implement OpenSearch on your page, and then finally some of the cool CSS fixes that we made for IE7.

I've uploaded my slides along with this post so that the info can be shared.  I'm don't have the samples that I showed available, but much of the info that I showed is included in the slides.  If you're looking for something specific, let me know and I'll try to get it up there for you!
