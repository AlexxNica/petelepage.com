<p>I just finished my session titled "Internet Explorer 7 From CSS to RSS: How To Take Full Advantage" here at Web Design World, and it went over pretty well.  Cameron Moll is currently doing a session right now, so we did lose quite a few people to him, but he's an excellent speaker and is showing some really cool CSS and design stuff, so I understand why they're over there.</p>
<p>I talked about some of the cool features around IE7, like what quirks mode is vs. standards mode; how to use RSS on your site, how to implement OpenSearch on your page, and then finally some of the cool CSS fixes that we made for IE7.</p>
<p>I've uploaded my slides along with this post so that the info can be shared.  I'm don't have the samples that I showed available, but much of the info that I showed is included in the slides.  If you're looking for something specific, let me know and I'll try to get it up there for you!</p>
