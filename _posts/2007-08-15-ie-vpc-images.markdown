<p>Just a quick note to let everyone know the IE VPC images will be coming VERY shortly.Â  Since this is the first time I've had someone else create them, it's taken a little longer than I expected it to.</p>
<p>I hope to have the images online sometime tomorrow, and I'll post once they're up both here and on the IE blog.</p>
