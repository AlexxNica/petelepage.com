Just a quick update to let you know the work for the IE6 VPC has been mostly completed.  We're down to the last few steps, and I hope to have it out by the end of the week.

Before we release it, I'll be testing it on the PC, and I also want to test it on VPC for the Mac, as I heard a few people say it wouldn't work there.

It'll be pretty much the same as last time, though I had to create a new image, I did manage to get it a hair smaller.  It'll have about a 4 month time bomb on it again, and the same EULA.

Feel free to make any other requests and I'll see what I can do, but no promises!
