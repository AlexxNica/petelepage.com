<p>What a fantastic day!&nbsp; I'm back in my hotel after a pretty long, but very good day.&nbsp; Up this morning at the crack of dawn and over to the Toronto Congress Centre for the VS 2005, SQL 2005 and BizTalk launch events.&nbsp; This was the first of a 10 city Canadian launch tour, and it was fantastic!&nbsp; Over 4,000 people, one of the biggest product launches in Canada. EVAR.&nbsp; ;)</p>
<p>The day was kicked off by the president of Microsoft Canada, who then turned the stage over to Craig Symonds, the General Manager of Visual Studio (and fellow Canadian).&nbsp; The excitement level for the keynote wasn't as high as I would have hoped, but it was pretty fantastic.&nbsp; We had some GREAT presentations, and really cool videos and lots of very informative stuff.&nbsp; I didn't realize how powerful and how BIG a change SQL Server 2005 was.&nbsp; Sure, I knew it was this big cool thing, but wow, that sucker ROCKS!</p>
<p>Post keynote, the "experts" all headed into the pavilion where we had an opportunity to talk to you!&nbsp; We answered tonnes of questions, and there were lots of you with ASP.NET questions, which was great!&nbsp; I was able to answer most of them, and if I couldn't I did give out a few business cards so that people can contact me to get more info about what they need.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The top 3 questions I had for the day were:</p>
<ol>
<li>ASP Classic to ASP.NET migration - how the heck do you do it?</li>
<li>What is the story on moving web parts from VS2005 to SPS or SPS to VS2005</li>
<li>What's Atlas or what is Microsoft's AJAX story.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p>One of the coolest things was being able to answer these questions and get people excited about VS2005 and ASP.NET 2.0.&nbsp; Lots of people who have read my blog are familiar with ASP.NET 2.0.&nbsp; But lots of the launch event atendee's were familiar with ASP and haven't done much ASP.NET work, so they have some interesting work ahead of them.&nbsp; But they now have a product team contact, and they love that.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, they got a few of us up on stage, in front of a few hundred people and let them throw questions at us.&nbsp; I'm a bit of&nbsp;an attention junkie. I love being on stage and having an opportunity to either present things, or answer questions, and so to the guy who asked about master pages today.&nbsp; Thanks :)&nbsp; Sorry I couldn't give you the answer you wanted (you can't nest master pages in design time, but you can&nbsp;in runtime).&nbsp; And to the few others who gave me an opportunity to speak, thanks!&nbsp; I enjoyed!</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'm heading up to Ottawa.&nbsp; I'll be at the MVP event at the Microsoft Office tomorrow evening, so if you're there, say hi!&nbsp; Or, if you're at the launch event on Thursday, be sure to find me!</p>
<p>Oh yah, pictures.&nbsp; I took a few but haven't posted them yet.&nbsp; The launch team here is posting a bunch of htem on flicker at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/launch2005/">http://www.flickr.com/groups/launch2005/</a>&nbsp;so be sure to check that out!</p>
