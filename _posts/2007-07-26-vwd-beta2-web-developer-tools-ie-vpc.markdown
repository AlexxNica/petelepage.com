So as it turns out, it's been a while since I last posted.  Things have been a little nutty around here.  We just finished our fiscal year, and have started planning for our next fiscal year.  It's been really exciting, lots of cool stuff happening around the next version of IE, planning for Expression Web 2, and getting ready for the launch of Visual Web Developer.

## Visual Web Developer Beta 2

In fact, [Visual Studio 2008 Beta 2](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700831.aspx), including [Visual Web Developer Express Beta 2](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/express/future/bb676747.aspx) is now available! I'm really excited that they're now available as they've come a long way since Beta 1.

If I had to name my top three fav features of VWD 2008, I guess I would say that they are:

1.  JavaScript enhancements, including [intellisense](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/06/21/vs-2008-javascript-intellisense.aspx), and [debugging](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/07/19/vs-2008-javascript-debugging.aspx)
2.  [CSS and HTML enhancements](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/07/25/vs-2008-web-designer-and-css-support.aspx)
3.  [Data Access Improvements with LINQ](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/05/19/using-linq-to-sql-part-1.aspx)

I'm really excited to see these guys get to Beta2.  This is the team that I was on before I moved to my current role, and I've got a special place in my heart for them.  They've done some awesome work here, and I'd recommend checking out VWD or VS Pro.

## Web Developer Tools

At TechEd this year, John Hrvatin presented a chalk talk about developer tools for Internet Explorer.  It was fantastically well attended, the room was overflowing!  We're looking at ways we can rebroadcast the session online to share with all involved.  But he did post a blog post a couple of weeks after TechEd with a [summary of all the tools](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/06/22/from-microsoft-teched-2007-web-development-tools-for-internet-explorer.aspx).  It's certainly worth checking out.

I think my top three tools are:

*   [IE Developer Toolbar](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=92716)
*   [Fiddler](http://www.fiddler2.com/)
*   [Visual Web Developer 2008 Express](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/express/future/default.aspx) (okay, so it's not a add-on, but it works great with IE or any other web browser for web development)

## IE VPCs

I've had a few emails the last week or two asking if we're going to update the IE VPCs that are available, as the time-bomb expiry is approaching.  I've already started working on them, and should have them online in the next couple of weeks.  I'm aiming to get them up by the 10th of August.

This round, instead of building them myself, I'm working with someone else to get them built, so it's a bit of a different process.  I've given them all the instructions that I have, and once I get the images from them, I'll do a few tests on them to make sure everything works correctly, and then roll them out.

We'll release an IE6 and an IE7 VPC image again this time both based on Windows XP SP2 + the latest patches.
