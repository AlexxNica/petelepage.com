If you've read [Brian's blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/bgold/archive/2005/08/01/446301.aspx), you've probably already heard that we released the ASP.NET 2.0 Provider toolkit.&nbsp; It sounds pretty cool, and has a bunch of great things available in it.

*   Source code for the Access Database providers (these were cut from Beta2, and won't be in the RTM product)
*   The provider data pattern, so you can learn how to create your own data access components

This is the first stage of the provider release, so you can expect to see additional tools posted here, and the like.&nbsp; The important thing here is that we're trying to make it super easy for you to build your own custom providers so that you can get ASP.NET 2.0 to work in your environment.
