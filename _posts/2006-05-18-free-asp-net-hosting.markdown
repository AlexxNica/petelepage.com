A few weeks ago, one of the forum posts I was looking at asked about free ASP.NET hosting.  I knew when we had shipped, we had offered some, but do you think I could find it a few weeks ago when someone really wanted it?  Of course not.

[http://www.vwdhosting.net/](http://www.vwdhosting.net/) is the URL for free hosting.  It's only a 30 day trial, but does offer a decent amount of hosting, and even SQL Server database access.  One of the cool things they've already got some of the start kits set up with an easy deployment setup.

If you're looking for a quick place to try hosting your web application as a proof of concept, check this place out!![](http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=600644)
