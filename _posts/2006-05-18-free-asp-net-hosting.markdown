<p>A few weeks ago, one of the forum posts I was looking at asked about free ASP.NET hosting.  I knew when we had shipped, we had offered some, but do you think I could find it a few weeks ago when someone really wanted it?  Of course not.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vwdhosting.net/" target="_blank">http://www.vwdhosting.net/</a> is the URL for free hosting.  It's only a 30 day trial, but does offer a decent amount of hosting, and even SQL Server database access.  One of the cool things they've already got some of the start kits set up with an easy deployment setup.</p>
