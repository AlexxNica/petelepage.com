<p>Every once in a while I hear things that I want to blog about as soon as I hear about them, but we're kind of embargo'ed on them, and this was one of them.&nbsp; In fact, I had even forgotten we were going to announce this today until it was mentioned at our Product Unit Meeting.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Yep, if you've been using Visual Web Developer Express, or have been holding off, check it out!&nbsp; The final word came down today that the Express versions of Visual Studio are going to be free!&nbsp; Up until now, there was the understanding that if you wanted to get a copy after November 7th, 2006, you'd have to pay about $50, but this "threat" has been removed!</p>
<p>So what's stopping you from downloading?&nbsp; Oh wait, if you're reading this, you've likely already downloaded it!&nbsp; Thanks!</p>
