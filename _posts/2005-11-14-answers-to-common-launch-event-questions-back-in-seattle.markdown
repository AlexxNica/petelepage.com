Wow, well, I'm back in Seattle and sitting at my desk here in Redmond today, and I'm stoked.&nbsp; The fact that VS 2005 is in your hands now is fantastic.&nbsp; I'm really excited to see and hear the feedback from everyone out there and how excited everyone is.&nbsp; We've had over 82,000 downloads for [Visual Web Developer Express](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/vwd/default.aspx) so far, and that is utterly fantastic!&nbsp; 

I wanted to link back to one of my previous posts for answers to the most common questions that I got at the VS launch events in Toronto and Ottawa.&nbsp; Check out [http://blogs.msdn.com/petel/archive/2005/11/10/491362.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/petel/archive/2005/11/10/491362.aspx)&nbsp;for answers to such things as **ASP Classic to ASP.NET Migration**, **Atlas and AJAX, WebParts in ASP.NET 2.0 and SharePoint**.&nbsp; &nbsp;

There are [plenty of pictures ](http://www.flickr.com/groups/launch2005/)available from the launch, and I dropped my film (yes, film) off at the lab this morning, so I should have it back late this week and I'll post a few of them then.&nbsp; If you didn't see me, I was shooting with a Holga, a cheap plastic toy camera for some fun stuff.&nbsp; We'll see how it turns out.&nbsp;
