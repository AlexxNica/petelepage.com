<p>Wow, well, I'm back in Seattle and sitting at my desk here in Redmond today, and I'm stoked.&nbsp; The fact that VS 2005 is in your hands now is fantastic.&nbsp; I'm really excited to see and hear the feedback from everyone out there and how excited everyone is.&nbsp; We've had over 82,000 downloads for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/vwd/default.aspx">Visual Web Developer Express</a> so far, and that is utterly fantastic!&nbsp; </p>
<p>I wanted to link back to one of my previous posts for answers to the most common questions that I got at the VS launch events in Toronto and Ottawa.&nbsp; Check out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/petel/archive/2005/11/10/491362.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/petel/archive/2005/11/10/491362.aspx</a>&nbsp;for answers to such things as <strong>ASP Classic to ASP.NET Migration</strong>, <strong>Atlas and AJAX, WebParts in ASP.NET 2.0 and SharePoint</strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/launch2005/">plenty of pictures </a>available from the launch, and I dropped my film (yes, film) off at the lab this morning, so I should have it back late this week and I'll post a few of them then.&nbsp; If you didn't see me, I was shooting with a Holga, a cheap plastic toy camera for some fun stuff.&nbsp; We'll see how it turns out.&nbsp; </p>
