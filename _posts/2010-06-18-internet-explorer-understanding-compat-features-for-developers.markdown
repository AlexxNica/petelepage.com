[![IE9DocMode](/assets/IE9DocMode.png "IE9DocMode")](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/06/16/ie-s-compatibility-features-for-site-developers.aspx)The IE Engineering team posted a great blog post on the [IE Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie) yesterday about the compatibility features of Internet Explorer 9 that is really worth checking out – it explains in great depth about the different modes that Internet Explorer offers as well as provides some best practices for how to make sure your code works exactly the way **you** expect it to!

They even went so far as to create a flow chart type diagram that shows how Internet Explorer chooses which rendering engine to use when displaying a page, both as a png (which I’ve included below) and as [SVG](http://ieblog.members.winisp.net/misc/How%20IE9%20Determines%20Document%20Mode.svg) diagram!

And in other cool news, the product management team (the team I’m on) also started a blog this week, Ryan Gavin posted the first post and it should be an interesting read. If you’re a web designer or web developer, you’ll likely want to stick with the IE Engineering Blog, but pop over to our other blog once in a while, it should make for some interesting reading about things that aren’t quite engineering related!
