<p>They even went so far as to create a flow chart type diagram that shows how Internet Explorer chooses which rendering engine to use when displaying a page, both as a png (which I’ve included below) and as <a href="http://ieblog.members.winisp.net/misc/How%20IE9%20Determines%20Document%20Mode.svg" target="_blank">SVG</a> diagram! </p>

<p>And in other cool news, the product management team (the team I’m on) also started a blog this week, Ryan Gavin posted the first post and it should be an interesting read.&#160; If you’re a web designer or web developer, you’ll likely want to stick with the IE Engineering Blog, but pop over to our other blog once in a while, it should make for some interesting reading about things that aren’t quite engineering related!&#160; </p>
