I'm looking for an RSS reader for the PC that will allow me to have different categories for different RSS feeds.&nbsp; So for example, I can group all the technology ones together, all of the ASP.NET stuff together and so forth.&nbsp; I'd prefer it not integrate with Outlook, but if thats what the best option is, I'll go with it.

What do you use?
