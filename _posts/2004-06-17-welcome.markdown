<p>As I think every other blogger has mentioned, there is always a first post, and its usually pretty lame.&nbsp; So here's mine.&nbsp; I'm a tester on the web designer surface of VisualStudio.&nbsp; I've been at Microsoft for about 3 years now, and have been on this team the entire time.&nbsp; We're working on some awesome stuff, and want to hear what you think about it.</p>
<p>I also own the Designer Smart Tasks that pop up next to a number of controls when they are dropped on the page.&nbsp; They're a great way to get stuff done quickly and easily!&nbsp; They were a tonne of fun to test, as they are pretty dynamic, and useful!</p>
<p>My main guy in crime is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bencon/">BenCon</a> who is the dev for this&nbsp;area.&nbsp; If you can convince the two of us to get something done, we'll do our best to make sure it has some distinction in the way the product moves.&nbsp; </p>
