This is great new for designers and developers alike, and I'm really excited!&nbsp; With ASP.NET 1.x and ASP.NET 2.0, if you wanted to create pure CSS pages, it really wasn't possible.&nbsp; The ASP.NET controls would render with tables, inline styles and all sorts of other things that would make most web designers wince.&nbsp; And for a while, we've had a beta version of the ASP.NET CSS Control Adapters available.

As I was reading through some of my morning news, I saw a post that the [ASP.NET CSS Control Adapters have gone RTM](http://forums.asp.net/1473749/ShowThread.aspx#1473749)!&nbsp; You can download them, and see samples of them working at [http://www.asp.net/cssadapters/](http://www.asp.net/cssadapters/)

If you're doing any kind of ASP.NET development, and want to make your site more CSS friendly, check them out!&nbsp; They're free!
