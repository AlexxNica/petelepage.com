I consider myself a developer more than a designer.  In fact, I’m pretty bad at web design.  I know what looks nice, and I know what doesn’t work well, but I’m not so good at creating kick butt designs.  So, at TechEd last year, I presented “Top 10 Mistakes Made By Web Developers” and it went over extremely well, and I was asked to do it again this year.  I did it twice at TechEd EMEA in Barcelona, and was asked to do it twice this year as we filled the room the first time!

Since it was an Interactive session, it’s not recorded, nor are the slides put online but I offered to share [some of the sites](http://blogs.msdn.com/petel/archive/2008/11/14/top-10-web-mistakes-from-teched-emea.aspx) I used both as good sites and bad sites and also share the slides!

I’ll be posting the demo code from WUX310 later this week!

Thanks!
