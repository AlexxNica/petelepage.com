<p>I consider myself a developer more than a designer.  In fact, I’m pretty bad at web design.  I know what looks nice, and I know what doesn’t work well, but I’m not so good at creating kick butt designs.  So, at TechEd last year, I presented “Top 10 Mistakes Made By Web Developers” and it went over extremely well, and I was asked to do it again this year.  I did it twice at TechEd EMEA in Barcelona, and was asked to do it twice this year as we filled the room the first time!</p>
<p>Since it was an Interactive session, it’s not recorded, nor are the slides put online but I offered to share <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/petel/archive/2008/11/14/top-10-web-mistakes-from-teched-emea.aspx">some of the sites</a> I used both as good sites and bad sites and also share the slides!</p>
<p>I’ll be posting the demo code from WUX310 later this week!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
