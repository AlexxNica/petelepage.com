<p>I was reading some mail I got today, and it looks like we're in the midst of releasing the August CTP to MSDN subscribers.&nbsp; Yay for new bits.&nbsp; Even more Yay for bits that have been declared Internal RC0!&nbsp; Yep, we've declared internal RC0.&nbsp; I'm not sure what that means as were still taking a few bugs every day (I found one yesterday and one of the interns found one also) that we really need to fix.</p>
<p>But here's the cool thing.&nbsp; We've not released bits that everyone (including non-MSDN subscribers) can download since beta2.&nbsp; But today we did!&nbsp; </p>

<p>You can download the August CTP express SKU's of RTM.50727.00&nbsp; </p>
<p>I strongly recommend you check out Visual Web Developer ;)</p>
