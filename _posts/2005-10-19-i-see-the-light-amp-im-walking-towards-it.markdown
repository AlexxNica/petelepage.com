<p>No, I'm not dying, and I'm not about to move groups, but as this week wraps up, a couple of really AWESOME things happen here for me and my team, that I'm really excited about, and I think you should be too!&nbsp; Okay, really, one you'll be happy about and the other you will probably care less about.</p>
<p>First, I'm down to only 9 tests left to automate for Whidbey.&nbsp; We started this product cycle with a plan of automating all pri0, pri1 and pri2 tests.&nbsp; It was an ambitious goal, seeing that we walked into the Whidbey product cycle behind the dev's.&nbsp; They had almost a year of coding headstart on us, so we were playing a catch up game the entire product cycle.&nbsp; It's not fun when features have to be cut because there isn't enough QA resources to adequately test them.&nbsp; And while that didn't happen too much, some really great ideas for Whidbey were punted to Orcas because we didn't have time to take them on.&nbsp; Over the last 3 years, we've built an automation test infrastructre from scratch, and then automated 4300 tests.&nbsp; We've also learned a lot in that time about what kind of tests work best, what issues we run into the most, and how to create a very robust test infrastructure.</p>
<p>The other light, the one you guys will be more excited about, is the release of Visual Studio 2005 (Whidbey), to hit the streets on November 7th.&nbsp; MSDN subscribers, ASPInsiders and other such influencers may be able to get it earlier, but no promises there.&nbsp; There is a cool site that has all sorts of info about the launch at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/2005launchevents/default.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/events/2005launchevents/default.mspx</a>&nbsp; I'm going to try to make the Seattle launch event, but not sure yet who's organizing it, so I'm not sure who I need to talk to! ;)</p>
