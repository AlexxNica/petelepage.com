<p>We've just started scratching the surface on Orcas on our team.&nbsp; We're currently in the middle of a bugbash playing with the new designer surface in Orcas.&nbsp; There are days when I love my job, and today is certainly one of them.&nbsp; I spent my morning helping out on the MSDN Forums, making sure we get your questions answered, but then I started into the bug bash.</p>
<p>My standard bug bash procedures.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start high energy &amp; high beat dance music (current listening to <a href="http://www.masterbeat.com/">Masterbeat</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006EXLW/qid=1137111535/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl15/103-0567176-1361457?n=507846&amp;s=music&amp;v=glance">Fusion.3</a>)</li>
<li>Consume 1 can <a href="http://www.redbull.com/">RedBull</a> ("it gives you wings")</li>
<li>Bash Product</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm only at 1 can of RedBull so far, I'll probably grab another one here in a minute or two, and start bashing again.&nbsp; So far I'm the top bug finder, at just about 20 bugs.&nbsp; <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dannychen">Danny</a> and I have this thing going to beat our <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdixon/">lead</a>.&nbsp; He's only filed 18 and has left for the day, so I figure he's going down.&nbsp; But I think I can double my numbers before the day is out!</p>
<p>We don't get to do this too often, but when we do, and the product is in the state it's in, it is a lot of fun!&nbsp; A lot of the bugs we're looking for right now are so that we can get our automation working again.&nbsp; There are quite a number that are blocking our automation, thus we can't really get many of our tests working, and this bash is meant to fix that.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Well, back to the bash! :)</p>
