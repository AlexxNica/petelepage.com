# [By the Community, For the Community!](http://www.asp.net/Default.aspx?tabindex=6&amp;tabid=50)

I'm really excited to announce a new community program on the [ASP.NET website](http://www.asp.net/) called By the Community, for the Community.  It's a system to help out everyone, and give some great community members a platform from which to show off their work.  Every couple of weeks, we'll announce 3-6 new topics.  You then get to vote on them, and choose the one that would be most helpful to you.  At the end of the voting period, our MVP's will create a sample based on the most requested idea!  We've got 6 great MVP's lined up to create samples, and they're really stoked about creating these and showing people how to get this stuff to work.

This vote is open as of today, and will be open until next Friday (July 14th), and we'll have the sample up by August 4th.  No one has created any of these samples yet, so it's going to take a few weeks to get them done and properly reviewed.  After that, the votes will normally start happening weekly.

Got an idea for a sample, send me a comment and I'll try to get it added to the list.  These samples aren't created by Microsoft or selected by people here at work, but instead, created and selected by you!

Check it out at [http://www.asp.net/Default.aspx?tabindex=6&amp;tabid=50](http://www.asp.net/Default.aspx?tabindex=6&amp;tabid=50)

And look for another cool community announcement sometime next week!  This one is going to be just as cool, if not cooler!
