I can’t believe it’s already been almost a year since [MIX06](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/mix06/), and the countdown for [MIX07](http://www.visitmix.com/) has started. With 63 days until MIX07 starts, and the early bird discount still available, now is the time to [register](http://www.visitmix.com/registration/)!

While the list of sessions is still being finalized, the IE team is going to be there in force again this year. We’ve already announced a few IE specific sessions, including “IE7 Past, Present and Future”, “Making Money with RSS”, and “Thinking in CSS: How to Build Great Looking Sites with Molly Holzschlag.” MIX is a great opportunity to learn about all kinds of web development, and it’s also a cool opportunity to meet and chat with people who work directly on Internet Explorer.

MIX07 isn’t just about Internet Explorer though, it’s all about building great web experiences. [Robbie Bach](http://www.visitmix.com/bios/#robbieb), the president of Microsoft’s Entertainment and Devices Division (makers of Xbox 360 and Zune, among other cool things), discusses some of the exciting new digital marketing and media opportunities created by new devices, and he’s got some cool stories to share from the frontier of technology. [Scott Guthrie](http://www.visitmix.com/bios/#scottgu) and [Ray Ozzie](http://www.visitmix.com/bios/#rozzie) from Microsoft and [Michael Arrington](http://www.visitmix.com/bios/#arrington) from [TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/) will also be doing keynotes, which I’m sure will be pretty cool.

I could talk about all the cool parties, the fact that every attendee gets a free copy of Windows Vista Ultimate, the free lattes, or the IE7 massage bar, but really, MIX is all about how to harness the latest technologies, unlock new ways of making money, reduce development costs, and improve your customers’ experiences.

I hope to see you at Mix07!
