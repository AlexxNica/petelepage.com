<p>It's alive!*<br />
<h2><a href="http://www.bbpphoto.com/" target="_blank">http://www.BBPPhoto.com</a> </h2>
<p>My new fine art photography web site is up and working. I've got one more tweak to do, and then I'm all set! It's running some special stuff.&nbsp; Basically I'm using a back end photogallery web application that provides an RSS feed, then using the RSS feeds to fill the front end with the data that I'm showing.</p>
<p>*It may take a few minutes for DNS to finish propigating. So, if it doesn't load, check again later this morning (PST).</p>
