I think the only let down I had at Mix06 this year, was the fact that we weren't doing any demos of Sapphire, the version of the VWD web designer.&nbsp; For those of you who haven't heard, we're starting from the ground up again, and taking a slightly different, and much better tact.&nbsp; First off, we're ripping out the old designer surface.&nbsp; The HTML editor will still be the same, but the HTML designer is getting completely redone.

Our designer surface in VS2003 and VS2005 is based on a version of IE, and had many wonky and weird issues.&nbsp; I'd file a bug, and our dev's would start investigating, only to come out of the pit of dispair a week later not having even found the area where the bug resides.&nbsp; There were quite a few issues like that.&nbsp; The code base was so huge, and very few people knew it well enough to be able to fix some of the more nasty (though thankfully somewhat rare) bugs.&nbsp; With our new designer surface, there are plenty of people who understand it, and it's so much better!&nbsp; 

As you might expect though, since it's early in the product cycle, we're still finding plenty of bugs.&nbsp; I spent about an hour on Thursday and found about 10 bugs.&nbsp; It's still that easy.&nbsp; One of the cool things this new designer fixes is some of the more annoying CSS issues that VS2005 had.&nbsp; For example, I've been running a number of the CSS test suites on it, and it's been doing okay.&nbsp; It's not comparable to IE7 yet, but it is certainly getting there.&nbsp; And I've got another set of web sites I'm going to be running through it in the near future.
