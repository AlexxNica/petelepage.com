<p>Not to start a holy war on why you'd want to / not do this, but ... I wonder if you can get a MacBook Pro using BootCamp booted to Windows XP then run Virutal PC to boot OS X inside the Windows VPC?</p>
<p>Now that would be interesting, and kind of cool to run both OS X side by side with XP!  Practial uses, probably not much.  But an interesting academic experiment.</p>
