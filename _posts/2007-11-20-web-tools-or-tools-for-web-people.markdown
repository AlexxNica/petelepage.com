A couple of days ago, I got an email from the guys at [DebugBar](http://www.debugbar.com/) letting me know that they had just released their [Beta1](http://www.my-debugbar.com/wiki/ToDo/Beta) for Debug Bar 5.0.  They've got a pretty good tool bar for doing web design and web development in IE.  Their DebugBar adds features like a DOM Inspector, an HTTP Inspector, a JavaScript Console and Inspector, an HTML Validator among other things.  It's free for personal use, and the commercial license is easy to obtain.

There are a couple of other tools worth pointing out as well

*   [Fiddler2](http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/) a web debugging proxy written by one of the PM's on the IE team
*   [IE Developer Tool Bar](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=E59C3964-672D-4511-BB3E-2D5E1DB91038&amp;displaylang=en) the Microsoft IE Developer Toolbar.  There's lots of info on it [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/05/10/Internet-Explorer-Developer-Toolbar-_2D00_-Get-It-Now_2100_.aspx)
*   [IE6 and IE7 Virtual PC images](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=21EABB90-958F-4B64-B5F1-73D0A413C8EF&amp;displaylang=en)
*   [Visual Web Developer Express 2008](http://www.microsoft.com/express/vwd/) has great JavaScript debugging features
*   [AjaxView](http://research.microsoft.com/projects/ajaxview/) a great tool from MS Research for remotely monitoring web2.0 applications for doing perf work
*   [Nikhil's Web Development Helper](http://projects.nikhilk.net/Projects/WebDevHelper.aspx) is an add-on that helps AJAX and ASP.NET developers see what is going on with their code

Hope this helps!
