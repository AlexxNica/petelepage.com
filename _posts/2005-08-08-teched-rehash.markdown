Well, TechEd Orlando has been over for almost 2 months now :( and they've just put up a whole wack of ASP.NET slides, videos and demos for you to check out.&nbsp; If you couldn't make it to TechEd, this is a great opportunity to check out some of the stuff we were showing off, and find out about the new stuff that ASP.NET has, such as themes and such.
