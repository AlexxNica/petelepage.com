I often forget to blog about some of the cool events I attend until it's a little too late, but hey, better than blogging about it after the fact, when people can't even try to show up right?

Tomorrow, [Chris Wilson](http://blogs.msdn.com/cwilso/) and I are headed down to San Jose for an event put on by the [Silicon Valley Web Builders](http://www.svwebbuilder.com/) for a session that they're calling [Browser Wars: Episode II Attack of the DOMs](http://www.svwebbuilder.com/page/2%2F28%2F07+Browser+War+Episode+II).  Beside the name being something that bugs me a bit, this is going to be a fantastic event!

This is one of the few times that Internet Explorer, Firefox and Opera have been on stage together to talk about where the web goes next, and what their visions are for the future.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by what Chris has to say.  Chris and I sat down on Monday to figure out what we were going to say, and what we wanted to get across for this event.  We only have a 10 minute presentation.  After each browser vendor has done their presentation, we move into a discussion.

I'm going to take my camera, and a video camera, and try to get a few video clips that we can put online, so keep an eye on my blog early next week for a summary and photos!

PS: we're still working on judging the entries for the IE add-on contest, and should have the results up Monday or Tuesday!  Good luck to all who entered!
